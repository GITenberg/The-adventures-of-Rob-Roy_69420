THE ADVENTURES OF ROB ROY.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
COLIN AND OINA.
</h3>

<p>
The sun of a September evening&mdash;we need not
say in what year&mdash;was shining down a wild and
lonely glen, a few miles eastward from the head of
Loch Lomond, where a boy and a girl sat on the
slope of the green hill-side, watching a herd of
fifteen red-eyed, small, and shaggy black cattle,
with curly fronts and long sharp horns, that were
browsing mid-leg deep amid the long-leaved fern.
The place was one of stern and solemn grandeur.
</p>

<p>
Leaping from ledge to ledge, and foaming between
the grey and time-worn rocks, a mountain torrent,
red and fierce, swept down the steep slope of the
narrow glen, now disappearing in deep corries,
that were covered by dwarf birch, hazel, and alder
trees, and elsewhere emerging in mist and spray,
white as the thistle's beard, till it reached the lake
which reposed under the shadows of the vast Ben
Lomond, whose summits were hidden in grey mist.
</p>

<p>
Ben Lawers, which towers above the source of
the Tay, and Ben More, that looks down on the
Dochart with its floating isle, are there; but the
king of these is Ben Lomond, a name which means
in English "the hill of the lake full of isles," for
four-and-twenty stud the loch below; and the bare
scalp of that mighty mountain rises to the height of
3,300 feet above the water.  There the wild winds
that came in sudden gusts down the glens, furrowed
up the bosom of the loch, causing its waters to
ripple on the silent shore, and on its verdant isles,
with a weird and solemn sound.
</p>

<p>
But here where our story opens, the shrill note
of the curlew, as he suddenly sprang aloft from the
thick soft heather, made one start; while the rush
of the many white watercourses that poured over
the whinstone rocks, and woke the silence, was
sharp and hissing.  The setting sun shed a flood of
purple light along the steep-sided glen, making the
heather seem absolutely crimson.
</p>

<p>
The boy and girl, Colin Bane, the son of a widow,
and Oina MacAleister, belonged to the clachan, or
village&mdash;the smoking chimneys of which alone
indicated its locality&mdash;about three miles off; for the
walls of the little cottages so closely resembled the
grey rocks of the glen, and their roofs, thatched
with heather, blended so nearly with the mountainside,
that, except for the forty little columns of
white vapour that ascended into the clear evening
sky, there was nothing else to indicate a human
habitation.
</p>

<p>
Neither of these young people was above twelve
years old; but the boy was tall, lithe, and manly
for his age.  His dark grey eyes were keen and
sharp as those of the wiry otter terrier that sat
beside him; and his bare legs, which his tattered
kilt revealed from the knee, showed that he was
handsome as well as strong&mdash;so strong, that he was
already entitled to wear a man's bonnet, as a proof
that he could lift and fling the "stone of strength,"&mdash;the
test of manhood, which lay beside the door
of Rob Roy's house, as beside that of every Highland
chieftain, to test the muscle of his growing
followers; for previous to being able to poise and
hurl the <i>Clachneart</i>, a boy wore his hair simply tied
with a thong.
</p>

<p>
A jacket of deerskin, fastened by wooden buttons
and loops of thong; a pouch or sporan composed of
a polecat's skin, with its face for a flap; and a skene
dhu (or black knife) stuck in a waist-belt, completed
the attire of Colin.
</p>

<p>
His pretty companion, who sat with her little
bare feet paddling in a pool of water that gurgled
from a rock, was enveloped in a short plaid of red
tartan, fastened under her chin by a little silver
brooch, and her thick brown hair, which she had
wreathed with blue bells and golden broom, fell in
masses on her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
But the faces of this boy and girl were thoughtful,
keen, and anxious in expression; for they were
children of a long-oppressed, outlawed, and broken
tribe, the MacGregors, or Clan Alpine.  Still, as
they tended the cattle, they sang merrily; for when
reaping in the fields, or rowing on the lochs, casting
the shuttle at the loom, or marching in the ranks
to battle, in those days the Scottish Highlander
always sang.
</p>

<p>
Ever and anon the boy and girl would pause and
utter a joyous shout, when a large brown salmon
leaped amid a shower of diamonds from the rough
stream that tore through the glen; or when a
sharp-nosed fox, a shaggy otter, or a red polecat came
stealthily out of the gorse and whins to drink of it;
for as yet they had no other visitors, and saw not
those who were secretly approaching.
</p>

<p>
Colin, who had started up to cast a stone at a wild
swan, and pursue it a little way, returned breathless;
but nevertheless, producing a chanter of hard
black wood, mounted with ivory rings, from his
girdle, in which it had been stuck, he said,&mdash;"Come,
Oina&mdash;Mianna Bhaird a thuair aois&mdash;sing,
and I shall play."
</p>

<p>
"It is a song of many verses, and is too long,"
replied the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Long!  There are only two-and-thirty verses,
and mother says that old Paul Crubach can
remember as many more."
</p>

<p>
Colin commenced the air at once upon his chanter,
and without further hesitation the girl began one
of the old songs which are half sung and half
recited, in a manner peculiar to the Highlands.
</p>

<p>
I have no intention of afflicting my readers with
all the said song in Gaelic; but it ran somewhat in
this fashion (a friend has translated it for me), and
the girl, as she sang sweetly, splashed the sparkling
water with her tiny feet:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lay us gently by the stream<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wanders through our grassy meads;<br>
  And thou, O sun! with kindly beam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light up the bower that o'er us spreads.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Here softly on the grass we'll sit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where flowerets bloom and breezes sigh;<br>
  Our feet laved in the gentle tide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, slowly gliding, murmurs by.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Let roses bright and primrose fair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sweet perfume and lovely hues,<br>
  Around us woo the ambient air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathe upon the falling dews.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Intent upon themselves and their simple occupation,
and singing thus in the fulness of their young
hearts to the objects of Nature, the boy and girl
saw not those who were coming up the glen,
creeping on their hands and feet, with keen eyes
and open ears.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Place by my hand (with harp and shell),<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long our solace and our pride,<br>
  The shield that often roll'd the swell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of battle from our father's side!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Let Ossian blind and tuneful Dall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike from their harps a solemn sound,<br>
  And open wide their airy hall&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bard will here, at eve, be found!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So closed the song, and at that moment a cry
burst from Oina, while Colin sprang up with a
hand on his knife, for suddenly there arose out of
the long tossing leaves of the braken, or fern, the
dark whins and matted gorse, amid which the cattle
grazed, about twenty well-armed and fierce-looking
Highlanders, whose tattered attire, green tartans,
and wild bearing, all proclaimed them to be strangers
and foes, who had come intent on spoil and hostility.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
THE CATERANS.
</h3>

<p>
With her eyes dilated by terror, and her usually
ruddy cheeks blanched and pale, the girl clung to
her companion, who stood resolutely between her
and those who had come so suddenly upon them.
Barking furiously, the otter terrier erected his
shaggy back and also shrunk close to the side
of Colin.
</p>

<p>
These unwelcome visitors were all armed with
basket-hilted swords, dirks, and pistols.  He who
seemed the leader bore a long <i>luagh</i>, or Lochaber
axe, the head of which is adapted for the triple
purpose of cutting, thrusting, or hooking an enemy.
They all wore waistcoats and hose of untanned
deerskin, rough, shaggy, and tied with thongs.
</p>

<p>
Their kilts and plaids were of tattered green
tartan, and all wore woollen shirts of dark red
dyes.  Only a few had bonnets; but in these they
wore a tuft of deer-grass, the badge of the
MacKenzies.  This, however, did not deceive the boy
or girl, who knew them to be MacRaes, who followed
the banner of Lord Seaforth.
</p>

<p>
The leader, a giant in stature, but fleet of foot
and active as a roebuck, was a dark-visaged and
savage-looking man, with eyebrows that met over
his nose, and were shaggy as the moustache that
curled round his fierce mouth, to mingle with his
beard.  His belted plaid was fastened by an antique
silver brooch covered with twisted snakes, and
silver tassels adorned his sporan, which was of
otter-skin covered with white spots; and hence
such skins are said in Scotland to belong to the
king of the otters.
</p>

<p>
"Keep your cur quiet, boy," said this formidable-looking
fellow, "or I must put a bullet into him.
Go on with your song, my girl, and don't be
alarmed; we shall not harm you."
</p>

<p>
"He is Duncan nan Creagh!" said Colin.
</p>

<p>
"And our cattle will be taken," sobbed Oina.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, while the boy and girl spoke their fears
in whispers, the gillies, or followers of Duncan
of the Forays, as he was named, ran round the
cattle in a circle, driving them together, by holloing
and striking them with cudgels or the flat sides of
their claymores&mdash;occasionally using the point, to
spur on the more lazy or refractory.  Undaunted
by the number of the caterans, Colin began to shout
shrilly and wildly for succour; but aid was far off,
and the echoes of the rocks alone replied.
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" exclaimed Duncan MacRae, fiercely,
"or I shall fling you into the pool, with a big stone
at your neck!"
</p>

<p>
The boy bravely brandished his skene, and
dipping his bonnet in the rivulet, as a defence for
his left hand, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Beware, you false cateran; these cattle are
from the lands of Finlarig; and Finlarig belongs
to Breadalbane."
</p>

<p>
The tall cateran grinned, and replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ay; but the beasties belong to the MacGregors&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"From whom all men may take their prey,"
added another.
</p>

<p>
"True, MacAulay, and were they Breadalbane's
own, every hoof and horn should be mine, even
though he were here, with all the Clan Diarmed of
the Boar at his back.  Hear you that, my little
man?  But the Griogarich&mdash;wheeugh!"
</p>

<p>
And the tall cateran snapped his fingers with
contempt and grinned savagely, as he made a
whistling sound.
</p>

<p>
This action, and the slighting manner in which
his clan was spoken of, made Colin tremble with
rage.  His ruddy cheek grew pale with emotion,
and his eyes flashed with light.
</p>

<p>
In pursuing a sturdy little bullock, one of the
MacRaes dropped a pistol.  Quick as lightning
young Colin sprang forward, possessed himself of
it, and fired full at the head of Duncan nan Creagh!
The latter reeled, for the ball had pierced his
bonnet, and grazed the scalp of his head, causing
the blood to trickle over his sombre visage.  Then,
before he could recover himself, the fearless boy
hurled the empty pistol, which was one of the heavy
steel <i>tacks</i> still worn with the Highland dress, at
the cateran's head, which it narrowly missed.
</p>

<p>
Oina and he now turned to seek safety in flight;
but the MacRae caught him by the hook of his long
poleaxe, and fearing further violence, the brave
Colin clung to his right arm with fierce energy.
Duncan tried to shake him off; but in vain.  At
last, he fiercely <i>bit</i> the hand of the poor boy, who
relinquished his hold with a scream of pain.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the savage fellow exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Wasp of a MacGregor, <i>that</i> will take the sting
out of you," and cut down Colin, by a single stroke
of his ponderous axe, severing his right (some say
his left) arm from his body.
</p>

<p>
Without a moan, Colin fell on the heather in a
pool of blood.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, lads, quick!" exclaimed the remorseless
Duncan; "drive on the prey; the MacGregors will
soon scent the blood and be on our track."
</p>

<p>
At some distance from the bleeding and dying
boy, Oina sank upon the ground, screaming wildly,
and covering her face with her hands and hair.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do with the girl?" said one;
"she will soon reach and rouse all the clachan."
</p>

<p>
"Take her with us," suggested another.
</p>

<p>
"Oich&mdash;oich! that would be kidnapping."
</p>

<p>
"But she is only a MacGregor's daughter," said
a third.
</p>

<p>
"And you shall soon be tracked by one MacGregor,
who will revenge us," exclaimed the girl,
whom excess of terror now endued with courage.
</p>

<p>
"Oich! and who may he be?" asked Duncan
nan Creagh, mockingly.
</p>

<p>
"Rob Roy of Inversnaid."
</p>

<p>
"The Red MacGregor&mdash;is that all?"
</p>

<p>
"All!  Conn Ceud Catha was a boy when compared
to him, as you shall soon find, false thief of a
MacRae."
</p>

<p>
"A swim in the linn will be good for one of your
temper," said the tall Cateran, as he took up the
girl, and regardless of her shrieks, rushing to where
the torrent that flowed towards Loch Lomond
poured over a brow of rock forming a cascade that
plunged into a deep pool below, he tossed her in,
without ruth or pity.
</p>

<p>
In falling, Oina caught the stem of a tough
willow, and clung to it with all the tenacity a deadly
fear could inspire.  The rush of the foaming torrent
was in her tingling ears, and its snowy spray
covered her face, her dress, and floating hair, as
she swung over it.  She closed her eyes and dared
not look; but her lips prayed for mercy in an
inaudible manner, for the power of speech had left
her.  And now, with her weight, the willow bent
so low that at last her feet and ankles dipped in
the rushing water; while with a pitiless frown, the
wild MacRae&mdash;for so this tribe was named, from
their fierce, lawless, and predatory habits&mdash;surveyed
her from the bank above.  Then saying,
"Oich&mdash;oich, but the Griogarich are folk that are
hard to kill," by a slash of his long axe he severed
the willow, and with a faint shriek Oina vanished
into the cascade that foamed beneath!
</p>

<p>
Duncan nan Creagh then hastened to overtake
his gillies, who by this time had driven the cattle
across the stream, which they forded in the old
Scottish fashion, with their swords in their teeth,
and grasping each other's hands to stem the current,
which, otherwise, must have swept them away
singly, as it came up to their armpits.
</p>

<p>
They then wrung the water from their plaids, and
driving the cattle at full speed by point and flat of
sword, hurried up a gloomy and lonely ravine, and
soon disappeared, where the sombre evening
shadows were deepening over the vast mountain
solitude.
</p>

<p>
Well did they know that the vengeful
MacGregors, whom some aver to be the Children
of the Mist, would soon be on their track,
following them with blade and bullet, hound and
horn.
</p>

<p>
The poor boy soon expired, but the girl was not
destined to perish.  She was swept by the torrent
round an angle of the rocks, towards a pool, where
a young man was fishing.
</p>

<p>
He saw her body whirling in the flood, and without
a moment of hesitation, cast aside his bonnet
and plaid, his rod and dirk, and plunging in, soon
caught her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
Being powerfully athletic, he stemmed the fierce
brown torrent, which ran like a flooded millrace,
bearing along with it stones, clay, and dwarf trees,
the spoil of the hills that look down on Loch
Dochart; and, after a severe struggle, he reached
the bank and laid the girl on the grass.
</p>

<p>
"Oina!" he exclaimed, with deep commiseration,
on removing the masses of wet brown hair from her
pallid face, for he recognized her to be the child of
his own foster-brother.
</p>

<p>
She was pale, cold, severely bruised by being
tossed from rock to rock, and lay there to all
appearance dead.  He placed a hand on her heart;
he opened and patted her clenched fingers; he
placed his warm ruddy cheek to her cold face, and
his ear to her mouth, to ascertain whether or not
she breathed.
</p>

<p>
Then taking her up in his arms as if she had been
an infant, he wrapped his plaid around her, and
with rapid strides, hastened towards the smoke,
which curled greyly against the now darkened sky,
and indicated where the clachan or village stood.
</p>

<p>
This man was Robert MacGregor of Inversnaid
and Craigrostan, otherwise known as Rob Roy, or
<i>the Red</i>, from the colour of his hair, and who, by
the proscription of his entire clan, had been
compelled by law to add the name of Campbell to his
own, for reasons which will afterwards be given to
the reader.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
THE ALARM.
</h3>

<p>
He soon reached Inversnaid, which lay about three
miles distant.
</p>

<p>
At first he walked but slowly, comparatively
speaking, as he believed the girl to be quite dead;
but the motion of her limbs, as he proceeded,
having caused the blood to circulate, he perceived
with joy that she still lived, and then he increased
his pace to a run, which soon brought him to the
cottage of her father, Callam MacAleister (<i>i.e.</i>, the
son of the arrowmaker), to whose care he consigned
her; and the bed of the little sufferer was rapidly
surrounded by all the commiserating gossips and
wise-women of the clachan.
</p>

<p>
No doctors were required by the hardy men of
these secluded districts.  Their wives and daughters
knew well how to salve a sore; to bind up a slash
from an axe or sword; to place lint on a bullet-hole,
or on a stab from a dirk; while valerian, all-heal,
liver-wort, and wild carrot, bruised in a quaichful of
whisky, formed the entire <i>materia medica</i> of the
matron of a family.  So men lived till patriarchal
years, strong, active, and fearless as mountain-bulls;
for sickness was unknown among them.
</p>

<p>
Of these female family physicians, Rob's wife,
the Lady of Inversnaid, was the queen in her time
and locality.
</p>

<p>
Inversnaid is a small hamlet on the estate of the
same name which formed the patrimony of Rob
Roy.  It lies two miles eastward from Loch
Lomond, on the bank of a small stream, which falls
into the great sheet of water, from a lesser, named
Loch Arklet, a place of gloomy aspect.
</p>

<p>
Northward, on the side of the latter, is a deep
and wild cavern, which sheltered Robert Bruce
after the battle of Dalree, in Strathfillan; and on
more than one occasion, in time of peril, it became
a place of concealment for our hero.
</p>

<p>
As MacGregor approached his own house&mdash;a
large and square two-storied mansion, the walls of
which were rough-cast with white lime, and which,
though thatched with heather, had an air of comfort
and consequence in that locality,&mdash;a wild cry,
that pierced the still air of the evening, made him
pause and turn round with his right hand on the
hilt of his dirk.
</p>

<p>
Alarmed by the protracted absence of the boy,
Fairhaired Colin, his widowed mother had sought
the glen where the foray had been.  The last red
gleam of the sunset had faded upward from the
summit of Ben Lomond, and the dark woods and
deep glens about its base were buried in all the
obscurity of night, till the moon arose, and then the
mountain-stream, and the pools amid the moss and
heather, glittered in its silver sheen.
</p>

<p>
The cattle had disappeared as well as their
young watchers, and the heart of the widow became
filled with vague alarm.
</p>

<p>
Now a mournful cry came at times upon the
wind of the valley, and made her blood curdle.
Was it the voice of a spirit of the air, or of a
water-cow, that had come down the stream from the loch?
Again and again it fell upon her ear, till at last she
recognized it to be the howling of her son's
companion and favourite, the little otter terrier; and
she rushed forward to discover the dog, which was
concealed by some tufts of broom.
</p>

<p>
The sweet perfume of the bog-myrtle was filling
the atmosphere as the dew fell on its leaves; and
now, deep down in the glen, where the soil had
never been stirred, where the heather grew thick
and soft, and where the yellow broom shed "its
tassels on the lea," the poor woman found her son,
her only child, lying dead, and covered with blood.
</p>

<p>
His right hand still grasped his skene dhu, and
near him lay the chanter, to the notes of which
Oina had sung, and a black, ravenous glede soared
away from the spot as she approached.
</p>

<p>
At first, his white and ghastly face, his fixed and
glazed eyes, struck terror on the mother's soul,
and she shrunk back&mdash;shrunk from the babe she
had borne, the child she had nursed; then she cast
herself in wild despair beside the body&mdash;in such
despair as had never filled her heart since the
Grahames of Montrose had hanged her husband,
Ian Bane, on the old yew-tree of Kincardine, for
the crime of being a&mdash;MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
Then endued by frenzy with superhuman strength,
she snatched up the dead boy, and bore him in her
arms, sending shriek after shriek before her, as she
rushed through the glen and across the moorland,
towards the clachan of Inversnaid.
</p>

<p>
It was her cry that Rob Roy heard, as he paused
at his own threshold, and turning away, he hastened
to meet her, just as she sank at the door of her
cottage.
</p>

<p>
The whole population of the clachan was speedily
alarmed, and the wailing of the women mingled
with the deep-muttered vengeance of the men, as
they began to arm, and looked to Rob Roy for
orders and instructions.
</p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE HOLY STEEL.
</h3>

<p>
The inhabitants of the little hamlet were soon
assembled in and around the hut of the widow of
Ian Bane.
</p>

<p>
The latter had been a brave man, sacrificed in
their feud with the Grahames, after the battle of
Killycrankie, where he had served under Viscount
Dundee.  He was long remembered on the Braes
of Balquhidder, as an expert swordsman, a hardy
deer-stalker, and a careful drover of cattle for the
English and Lowland markets, where he had
wont to march after his herds, with his sword at his
side, and a target slung on his back, as was then
the custom of the Highlanders to go to fair and
market.
</p>

<p>
A few lines will describe the residence of his
widow.
</p>

<p>
It was a somewhat spacious hovel, built without
mortar, of turf and stone, taken from the river's
bed, or from the adjacent moorland.  It had a little
window on each side, and these were wont to be
opened alternately, according to the part from
which the wind blew, to give light and air, opened
by simply taking out the <i>wisp</i> of fern which was
stuffed into the aperture in lieu of glass and
shutters.
</p>

<p>
A fire of turf and bog-fir blazed on the centre
of the clay floor; and here, in this poor dwelling,
the widow lived, amid smoke sufficient to suffocate
her (had she not been used to it from her infancy),
together with her slaughtered boy, her Fairhaired
Colin, and a brood of hens, whose roost was among
the rafters; a cow, two large dogs, and a sheep or
so in winter, though sheep were little cared for
in the Highlands then.
</p>

<p>
A few deer hams, and quantities of fishing gear,
hung from the rafters, amid which the smoke curled
towards an old herring cask, that was inserted in
the thatched roof to form a chimney.
</p>

<p>
Fresh fir-cones and bogwood were cast upon the
fire by order of Rob Roy; and now the ruddy blaze
lit up a wild and striking scene.  Near the centre
of the hut, on a rudely-formed deal table, lay the
dead body of poor Colin Bane MacGregor, the golden
hair from whence he took his sobriquet all matted
with purple blood; but a white sheet was now
spread over the mangled form, which lay stiff and
at full length in rigid angularity, with a platter of
salt upon its breast, and sprigs of rosemary strewed
crosswise over it.
</p>

<p>
At the feet of the dead, on her knees, knelt the
sorrowing mother, with her grizzled hair dishevelled,
and her face buried in her tremulous fingers, through
which the tears were streaming, as she rocked her
body to and fro.
</p>

<p>
Fully armed, three Highlanders of formidable
aspect and stately bearing stood at the head of
the corpse.  These were Rob Roy, Callam
MacAleister (his foster-brother and henchman), with
Greumoch MacGregor, one of his most active and
resolute followers.  Each leant upon a
brass-mounted and long-barrelled Spanish musket.
</p>

<p>
Grouped round were a band of hardy and weather-beaten
men, in rough Highland dresses of home-spun
and home-dyed tartan, all hushed into silence,
with their keen grey eyes bent darkly on the
corpse, or on each other, and with their brows
knit as their hearts glowed for vengeance on the
unknown perpetrator of this outrage; for as yet
no information could be gathered from the
half-drowned Oina.
</p>

<p>
Outside the door were the women of the clachan
with their heads muffled in plaids, kerchiefs, and
curchies, wailing as only the Celts of Scotland and
Ireland wail, in a weird, wild cadence, muttering
vengeance too, and suggesting to each other who
might be the author of this new item to the terrible
catalogue of wrongs that had been perpetrated on
the MacGregors since the battle of Glenfruin had
been fought, about a hundred years before.
</p>

<p>
And all this was seen by the red light of the
bogwood fire, in the wavering gleams of which, as
they played upon the winding-sheet, the corpse
seemed always as if about to start and arise.
</p>

<p>
"Ochon, ochon, ochrie!" wailed thu mother of
Colin, as she swayed herself to and fro; "the drops
of the blessed dew that God sends on earth are
resting on the cold cheek of my fair son this night;
and they are not more pure than he was; but I
knew he was doomed never to see the leaves of
autumn fall!"
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked several, bending forward to listen.
</p>

<p>
"He drew the black-lot, when the cake was
broken in Greumoch's bonnet on Beltane eve."
</p>

<p>
"Never say so, widow," said MacGregor; "think
only that the lad died as became his father's son,
boldly defending his own; God rest him!"
</p>

<p>
Here all bowed their heads, and many made the
sign of the cross.
</p>

<p>
"A slash with an axe has slain him," resumed
Rob Roy; "a sword would never cut so deep; but
the brave boy has defended himself, for his skene
is yet grasped in his better hand, so let it go to the
grave with him."
</p>

<p>
Mutterings of grim approval went through the
group.
</p>

<p>
"To you, Red Rob, I look for vengeance&mdash;for
vengeance on the murderers!" cried the mother
wildly, as she stretched her hands towards the
chieftain.
</p>

<p>
"And vengeance you shall have, Jean; by the
faith of our fathers, you shall!" replied Rob Roy.
"I have little doubt that the same hand which slew
Fair Colin, cast Callam's daughter into the river;
but time will show."
</p>

<p>
"We have the cattle to recover too," said several;
"let us to the hills&mdash;to the hills!  The creagh
(spoil) cannot be far off yet."
</p>

<p>
"What! are the cattle carried off?" asked Rob,
with a darkening frown.
</p>

<p>
"The cattle I bought at Fil-ina-chessaig&mdash;that
blessed 21st of March, at the fair of Callender&mdash;ay,
every hoof and horn," said Greumoch.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the blackest mail we ever levied will I
lay on these caterans, and the reddest blood we
have shed shall be theirs, Jean!  But there are
other wounds here," continued Rob, as he turned
down the winding-sheet; "look at the poor child's
hand: it has been <i>bitten</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Bitten as if by a wolf!" screamed the mother,
with growing horror.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, bitten by a man who has lost every
alternate tooth in his lower jaw, and by that mark
shall we know him!"
</p>

<p>
"Where? among the Buchanans or Cclquhouns?"
demanded several, while the excitement
grew apace.
</p>

<p>
"Among neither," exclaimed a harsh and croaking
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;why?" asked the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"For 'tis Duncan nan Creagh who did this;
Duncan Mhor, from Kintail na Bogh."
</p>

<p>
"Who spoke?" said Rob Roy, peering through
the smoke which obscured the atmosphere of the hut.
</p>

<p>
"I, Phail Crubach," replied a decrepit old man,
for whom all now made way, with a strangely
mingled bearing of respect and aversion; for this
visitor was supposed to have the double gift of
prophecy and the second sight.
</p>

<p>
Phail Crubach, or lame Paul MacGregor, was the
keeper of a Holy Well near the church of
Balquhidder.  He had been educated in youth at the
Scottish College of Douay; but on becoming partly
insane, he returned to his native place, and became
the custodian of a spring which St. Fillan had
blessed in the times of old.  Near this well he lived
in a hut, which was an object of terror to the
peasantry, as it was almost entirely lined and
patched with fragments of old coffins from the
adjacent churchyard.
</p>

<p>
At the door of this strange dwelling (on which
was a rusty coffin-plate as an ornament) he usually
sat and watched the well and the narrow highway,
ready to afford any wayfarer a draught from the
spring, for which he received a small remuneration,
either in coin or food&mdash;such as meal, cheese, butter,
and a bit of venison, which any man might then
have for the shooting thereof.
</p>

<p>
He was clad in a coat and breeches of deerskin;
he was wasted in form, wan in visage, and had red
hazel eyes, that glared brightly through the long
masses of white hair that overhung his wrinkled
forehead.
</p>

<p>
Supporting himself on a knotty stick, which had a
cross on its upper end, he hobbled forward through
the shrinking crowd.
</p>

<p>
"How know you, Paul, that Duncan Mhor MacRae,
from Kintail-of-the-cows, did this?" asked
Rob Hoy.
</p>

<p>
"Even by the words you have spoken, had I not
better evidence," replied the strange old man.
</p>

<p>
"Explain yourself, Paul; we have no time for
trifling now," said Rob, softly.
</p>

<p>
"Duncan nan Creagh lost each alternate tooth in
his lower jaw when fighting with Colin's father, at
the fair of Callender, in the year that the field of
Rin Ruari was stricken.  They came to dirk and
claymore about the price of a Clydesdale cow, and
Ian Bane smote Duncan on the mouth with the
hilt of his sword, and forced him to swallow a
mouthful of his own teeth; and a bitter mouthful
he found them."
</p>

<p>
"Dioul! well?"
</p>

<p>
"Since then he has been well-nigh a toothless
man; but if you would overtake the creagh, lose
no time, for I saw the spoil and the spoilers not
two hours since."
</p>

<p>
"You saw them?" exclaimed all, bending forward.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I," said Paul, brandishing his pilgrim-staff;
"and not quite two hours ago."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" asked Red MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
"Crossing the Dochart, and taking the road
towards Glenfalloch."
</p>

<p>
"Which&mdash;the military road?"
</p>

<p>
"No; Duncan nan Creagh knows better than to
do that," said Paul, shaking his white locks; "they
took the old Fingalian drove-road, right across the
mountains towards the north-west."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well, kinsman," said Rob Roy, sternly and
gravely; "now, men of Clan Alpine, swear with
me on the bare dirk, by the soul of Ciar Mhor, to
revenge the murder of this boy, our kinsman's son,
and then away to the hills&mdash;even the hills of Kintail,
if need be!"
</p>

<p>
On this being said, every man unsheathed the
long Highland dirk which hung at his right side,
and passed round the dead body by the course of
the sun, from east to west; for it was the custom
in the Highlands to approach the grave thus, prior
to laying the dead within it; thus to conduct the
bride to the altar and to her home: it is a remnant
of fire-worship, and, singularly enough, the
wine-decanters and the whisky-bottle are to this hour
sent round the dinner-table in Scotland, <i>deisalways</i>,
from left to right, the last remnant of a superstition
that is old as the days of the Druids.
</p>

<p>
Then Rob Roy, MacAleister, Greumoch, even old
Paul Crubach, and every man present, laid his left
hand on the cold head of the fair-haired Colin, and
holding his bare dirk aloft, with outstretched arm,
swore solemnly, by the souls of their fathers who
slept on Inchcailloch, by their own souls, and by
the memory of every wrong endured by the Clan of
MacGregor since the field of Glenfruin was won by
their swords, never to seek rest or repose, altar or
shelter, till they had tracked out the spoilers, and
avenged to the utmost the murder of the widow's
only son.
</p>

<p>
Then each man pressed the bare blade to his
lips, and this&mdash;the most solemn oath of the Scottish
Highlanders&mdash;was named swearing on <i>the Holy
Steel</i>; and he who broke that terrible vow, or
wilfully failed in the task to which he had dedicated
body and soul, was liable to be slain, even by his
nearest kinsman, as a mansworn coward.  The
usual length of these Highland dirks is about
sixteen inches in the blade; so that a stab may be
given three inches <i>beyond</i> the elbow, and their
hilts are always covered with twisted knot-work,
perhaps the last remnant of serpent-worship in
Europe.
</p>

<p>
"Now be it dirk and claymore!" exclaimed Rob
Roy.  "Do men still think to outrage us because
we are a broken and a landless clan?  If so, we
shall teach them who outlawed the race of Alpine,
that if it is lawful to kill a MacGregor, it is also
lawful to slay a MacRae, or a Colquhoun, like a
faulty hound; so let us to the hills at once, and
track the creagh!  Meet me at the door of my own
house in ten minutes, every man who holds dear the
cry for vengeance on our enemies."
</p>

<p>
"We cannot overtake them to-night," said
Greumoch; "for the Colquhouns of Luss have sunk
the ferry-boat, or stolen it to Rossdhu; so let us
cross the Loch-hean to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Dioul!  this counsel is not like yours, Greumoch,"
</p>

<p>
"By dawn the ford of the Dochart will be
passable," replied the clansman.
</p>

<p>
"To-night; I say to-night!" exclaimed Rob,
passionately.
</p>

<p>
"To-night!" reiterated all present, brandishing
their swords; "to-night be it, or never!"
</p>

<p>
"We will take the ford as we find it," said Callam
MacAleister; "if they passed it, so may <i>we</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Never let us put off till to-morrow that which
we can do or begin to do to-day," said Rob Roy.
"<i>Yesterday</i> passes into eternity fast enough; and,
Greumoch, it is a bitter reflection to a man, that
yesterday was a <i>lost</i> day&mdash;a day that never can be
overtaken.  All men's hands are against us; but I
have sworn, by the Grey Stone of MacGregor, that
vengeance shall yet be ours!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ard choille</i>, and away!" shouted Greumoch,
waving his bonnet, yielding to the general impulse.
</p>

<p>
Within a few minutes he, with MacAleister,
Alaster Roy MacGregor, and sixteen other picked
men of the hamlet, mustered at the door of Rob
Roy's mansion.  Each had on his belted plaid,
which means the kilt, with the loose end of the web
fastened by a brooch to the left shoulder as a
mantle.  Each had slung on his back a round
target of bull's hide, stretched over fir-boards, and
thickly studded with brass knobs; and each was
fully armed, with a basket-hilted sword, a long
dirk, and claw-butted pistols.  Their bullets were
carried in pouches, and their powder in horns,
slung under the right arm.
</p>

<p>
The bright moon that lit up the little street of
the Highland hamlet, glittered on their weapons,
and shone on their weather-beaten faces, which
expressed dark anger, eagerness, and determination
to overtake the perpetrators of the late outrage.
</p>

<p>
They spoke little, but, after the manner of their
countrymen, hummed or whistled in a surly fashion,
the sure precursor of a squabble among Highlanders;
and busied themselves with the flints and
priming of their pistols, or the thongs which tied
their cuarans or home-made shoes, the sole and
upper of which are in one piece, and worn like the
Roman sandal.  Armed like the rest, the Red
MacGregor soon came forth, and was greeted by a
murmur of applause.  "Good wife&mdash;Helen," he
exclaimed, "it is ill marching with a fasting
stomach; bring forth cakes and the kebboc, with a
dram of usquebaugh; for the lads must have their
deoch an doruis ere we start."
</p>

<p>
With a short plaid folded over her head and
shoulders, his wife, a young and pretty woman,
appeared at the door, accompanied by two female
servants, having oat-cakes, cheese, a bottle, glasses,
and quaichs (<i>i.e.</i>, little wooden cups) on an oval
mahogany teaboard.
</p>

<p>
Doffing his bonnet to the black-eyed Dame of
Inversnaid, each man took a dram of whisky and
a morsel of bread and cheese; more as a ceremony,
it seemed, than because it was necessary.
</p>

<p>
Little Coll MacGregor, then Rob's only child,
was held up for his father to kiss.  "Now,
fare-ye-well, Bird Helen," said he; "ere we return, I
will have laid the wolf's head on the heather;"
and with his followers, he left the hamlet at a
quick pace.
</p>

<p>
The wife of Rob Roy looked after them for a
moment, as their tartans waved, and their bright
arms flashed in the moonlight; then her eye
glanced down the glen, where the burn wound in
silver sheen towards Loch Lomond, and with a
single pious hope for her husband's safety, she
quietly shut the door, which was well secured by
triple locks and bars of iron, and which had,
moreover, two loopholes on each side, to fire muskets
through.  When not required for defence, these
apertures were closed within, by a plug of wood.
To her, the daughter of a proscribed race, the wife
of a levier of black-mail, reared as she had been in
the land of swordsmen, among fierce and predatory
clans, the departure of her husband on such a
mission was not a matter for much anxiety, and
yet this pursuit of the MacRaes was the first
important exploit of Rob Roy which appears
in history.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
THE RED MACGREGOR.
</h3>

<p>
"History," says a noble author, "is a romance
which is believed; romance, a history which is <i>not</i>
believed."  Hence so much that is fabulous
surrounds the name of Rob Roy, that, like Macbeth,
his real history and character become almost lost;
but I shall endeavour to tell the reader who and
what he actually was.  Rob Roy MacGregor, otherwise
compelled by law (for reasons which shall be
given elsewhere) to call himself <i>Campbell</i>, was in
his twenty-fifth year at the time our story opens.
</p>

<p>
He was the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel
Donald MacGregor, of Glengyle, in Perthshire, who
commanded a regiment of infantry in the Scottish
army of King James II. of England and VII. of
Scotland.  His mother was a daughter of Campbell
of Glenfalloch, a powerful Highland chieftain, nearly
related to the House of Breadalbane; consequently
his birth was neither obscure nor ignoble.  His
elder brother was named John, and he had two
sisters.  His patrimony was the small estate of
Inversnaid, near the head of Loch Lomond, and,
through his mother, he had a right to a wild
territory of rock and forest, named Craig-Royston, on
the eastern shore of that beautiful loch, under the
shadow of vast mountains; but, in virtue of the
arbitrary Act of the Scottish Parliament, which
abolished the name of MacGregor, he was always
designated, in legal documents, Robert Campbell,
of Inversnaid.
</p>

<p>
After the bloody clan-battle of Glenfruin, which
led to the proscription of the whole of his surname,
"few of the MacGregors were permitted to die a
natural death," says the historian of the clan.*
"As an inducement to murder, a reward was given
for every head of a MacGregor that was conveyed
to Edinburgh, and presented to the Council; and
those who died a natural death were interred by
their friends, quietly and expeditiously, as even the
receptacles of the dead were not held sacred.
When the grave of a MacGregor was discovered, it
was common for the villains employed in this trade
of slaughter, to dig him up, and mutilate the
remains, by cutting off the head, to be sold to the
Government, which seemed to delight in such
traffic."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Dr. MacLeay.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The historian proceeds to narrate that the chief
purveyor of such goods was a certain petty Laird of
Glenlochy, named Duncan Campbell, but more
usually known as Duncan <i>nan Cean</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, "of
the heads."
</p>

<p>
It chanced one night that Lieutenant-Colonel
MacGregor (the father of Rob Roy), accompanied
by three soldiers of his surname, was passing near
the ruins of the old castle of Cardross (wherein
Robert Bruce breathed his last, and which were
then visible, a little to the westward of the Leven,
in Dumbartonshire), when, in a narrow pathway,
they met a man leading a horse, on each side of
which a pannier was swung.
</p>

<p>
The path was rough, as well as narrow, and on
meeting four armed men suddenly in the dark, the
man shrunk from the bridle of his horse, which
reared, and caused the contents of the panniers
to make a strange noise among the straw in which
they were packed.
</p>

<p>
"Be not alarmed, good fellow," said Glengyle;
"we are not thieves, but soldiers in the King's
service.  What have you in the panniers?"
</p>

<p>
The man hesitated, and endeavoured to pass on.
</p>

<p>
"Speak!" said the Colonel, whose suspicions
became aroused; "is it plunder?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid&mdash;I am an elder of the kirk, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"Heads for the Lords of Council at Edinburgh,"
replied the stranger, gathering courage.
</p>

<p>
"Heads of whom?"
</p>

<p>
"The King's enemies."
</p>

<p>
"Mean you gipsies, or westland Whigs?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay; of the clan Gregor."
</p>

<p>
"He is Duncan nan Cean!  He is Duncan of the
Heads!" exclaimed Glengyle, with ferocious joy,
as he drew his sword.  "Villain, I have sought
thee long, and now <i>thy</i> head shall keep them
company!" and, by a single stroke, he, in an
instant, decapitated him.  The panniers were
examined by his followers, who, with rage and horror,
found therein several ghastly heads, packed in
straw.  These they immediately buried in a secret
place, and resumed their way before dawn.
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy's father received the tribute called
black-mail, for protecting, in arms, all who were
unwilling or unable to protect themselves.  This
tribute was, in every sense, a legal tax, which the
justices of the peace, in the counties along the
Highland border, enforced upon the heritors and
householders.  We know not when the Laird of
Glengyle died; but, on one occasion, he led three
hundred of his clan against the Macphersons, who
had given offence to his friend, the Earl of Moray,
and, in marching through the forest of Gaich, he
slew the deer, and the forester of Cluny, who had
resented their passage.
</p>

<p>
Red Robert, his second son, was about the middle
height, but had a frame possessed of vast strength
and great powers of endurance and activity.  His
shoulders were broad, his chest ample, and his
arms were so long that it was commonly said he
could garter his hose, below the knee, without
stooping.  This, no doubt, is exaggeration; but he
possessed
</p>

<p class="t3">
  A wondrous length and strength of arm,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
which gave him great advantage in combats with
the broadsword.  Of these he is said to have fought
no less than <i>twenty-two</i>.
</p>

<p>
Even in boyhood he excelled in the use of the
claymore and all other weapons; for this he was,
no doubt, indebted to the tutelage of his father,
old Donald of Glengyle, who had handled his sword
in the wars of the Covenanters and Cavaliers.
</p>

<p>
No man was ever known to <i>wrench</i> anything
from Rob's hands; and so great was his muscular
power that he would twist a horse's shoe, and drive
his dirk, to the hilt, through a two-inch deal board;
and on more than one occasion he has seized a
mountain stag by the antlers, and held it fast, as if
it had been a little kid.  He never, save once,
refused a challenge.  This was when a peasant,
named Donald Bane, drew a sword upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Beware, fellow," said Rob; "I never fight a
duel but with a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
His character was open and generous, and it
was ever his proudest boast that "he had never
been known to turn his back <i>either on a friend
or a foe!</i>"
</p>

<p>
His lands were frequently wasted, and his cattle
carried off, by bands of caterans from the mountains
of Ross-shire and Sutherland; hence, for his own
protection, he was compelled to maintain a party of
well-armed and resolute followers, who, like himself,
acquired great experience in war, with habits
of daring.
</p>

<p>
With an open and manly countenance, his features,
in youth, are said to have been pleasing and
cheerful in expression; but, by the course of life
upon which unjust laws and adverse fortune hurried
him, they gradually acquired that grave, and even
morose, aspect, which we find depicted in the
portrait of him possessed by Buchanan of Arden;
the brows are knit, the eyes stern, and the firm
lips compressed.  He has a moustache, well twisted
up, and a short curly beard, neither of which were
then worn in England, or the Scottish Lowlands.  He
wears a round, blue bonnet, with a black cockade,
and has his weather-beaten neck without collar
or cravat.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Two other portraits of Rob Roy are in existence.  One
belongs to the Antiquarian Museum at Edinburgh; the other to
the Duke of Argyle, and it had a narrow escape from the fire
which consumed the castle of Roseneath in 1802.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
His hair, from the colour of which he obtained
his sobriquet of Roy (a corruption of <i>ruadh</i>, or red),
was of a dark, ruddy hue, with short frizzly locks,
which he wore without powder&mdash;a foolish fashion
that was seldom found among the Highlanders, who
usually tied their hair in a club behind.  The
circumstance that MacGregor was named <i>Red</i> Robert,
to distinguish him from others, is sufficient to show
how false is the popular error which bestows hair of
that colour upon every Highlander.
</p>

<p>
"In his conflicts," says Sir Walter Scott, in the
introduction to the novel which bears our hero's
name, "Rob Roy avoided every appearance of
cruelty; and it is not averred that he was ever the
means of unnecessary bloodshed, or the actor of any
deed that could lead the way to it.  Like Robin
Hood of England, he was a <i>kind and gentle</i> robber,
and, while he took from the rich, was liberal in
relieving the poor.  This might be policy; but the
universal tradition of the country speaks of it to
have arisen from a better motive.  All whom I
have conversed with&mdash;and in my youth I have
seen some who knew Rob Roy personally&mdash;gave him
the character of <i>a humane and benevolent man</i>."
</p>

<p>
As yet, however, he was neither a robber nor an
outlaw; but simply a Highland country gentleman,
a chieftain of a broken clan, living under the
protection of his mother's name and kindred; farming
his little estate of Inversnaid; dealing in cattle,
then the chief wealth of our northern mountains;
and, being of a warlike disposition, occupying
himself as the collector of black-mail&mdash;the local tax
then paid by proprietors, whose estates lay south
of the Highland frontier, to certain warlike chiefs
and chieftains, northward of that line, for the armed
protection of their lands and goods from the
irruption of such caterans as those MacRaes, who had
stolen the cattle from Inversnaid, and of whom we
left Rob and his men in hot pursuit.
</p>

<p>
And it was the collection of this duty, <i>black-mail</i>,
which, in 1729, ultimately led to the embodiment
of the Black Watch, or 42nd Highland Regiment;
and it was continued to be levied by certain chieftains
so lately as the middle of the <i>last</i> century&mdash;certainly
until 1743.  At the time we have introduced
him to our readers Rob had been married for
some time, to a daughter of MacGregor, the Laird
of Comar.
</p>

<p>
Far from being the fighting amazon and fierce
virago whom Sir Walter Scott has portrayed,
Helen Mary, the goodwife of Inversnaid, was a
kind, gentle, and motherly woman, who never
flourished abroad with breast-plate, bonnet, and
broadsword, as we see her on the stage, when
opposing the bayonets of the redcoats; but who
attended to her frugal household, her spinning,
baking, and brewing; and who wore the simple
kerchief and <i>tonnac</i>, or short plaid, which, until the
close of the last century, formed the usual female
costume in the Highlands; and never, save once,
and then on a trifling occasion, did she act a stern
and resolute part, in an episode to be narrated in
its place.
</p>

<p>
The reader must bear in mind that Rob Roy was
not a chief at the head of a clan, but merely the
second son of a chieftain (the <i>second</i> rank) at the
head of a branch of the Clan Alpine, called the line
of Dugald Ciar Mhor (or Dugald with the mouse-coloured
hair), and the men of this branch adhered
to him, as being his immediate kinsmen and
tenants.
</p>

<p>
Deeply in the heart of Rob Roy MacGregor
rankled the story of the wrongs and oppression
to which his clan had been subjected by the
Scottish Government&mdash;wrongs which, after the
accession of William III., were rather increased
than diminished; and thus he burned for an opportunity
of avenging them at the point of his sword,
on their chief enemies, the Grahames of Montrose,
the Colquhouns of Luss, and others; and ere long
an ample opportunity came.  But meanwhile let us
return from this necessary digression, lest Duncan
of the Forays escape with his spoil.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
THE PURSUIT.
</h3>

<p>
The inroads of the Highlanders were generally
made upon the Lowlanders, whom they still view as
intruders and aliens; but since the proscription of
the MacGregors, every man might outrage <i>them</i>,
under protection of law, and "lift" their cattle, if
he could do so; and a knowledge of this increased
the wrath and resentment of Rob Roy and his
followers as they hastened after the MacRaes;
though why people of <i>that</i> name, whose home was
in Kintail, should have come so far to molest the
MacGregors, no one can explain.  In the bright
moonlight the pursuers soon reached the place from
which the creagh or spoil had been taken, the same
where this history opened, and where the widow's
son had been so cruelly slain.
</p>

<p>
There the MacGregor's sleuth-hound paused and
howled, where Colin's bonnet and the chanter, with
which he had accompanied Oina's song, lay on the
heather, and again he uttered a low prolonged howl
on snuffing the odour that came from a patch of
heath, the darkness of which might make one shudder.
</p>

<p>
It was the crusted blood of the poor boy's death-wound
which still lay there.  "Callam, lead the dog
across the stream," said Rob; "he must find the
scent on the other side; let him but once snuff
their footmarks, and then woe to the MacRaes!"
</p>

<p>
MacAleister, the henchman, dragged the fierce
dog, by its leash, across the stream.  It was a
bloodhound of the oldest and purest breed, being
all of a deep tan colour with black spots, about
two feet four inches high, with strong limbs, a
wide chest, broad savage muzzle, and pendulous upper lip.
</p>

<p>
Crossing the stream hand in hand, with their
pistols in their teeth, to keep the flints and priming
dry, the MacGregors reached the opposite bank,
while the dog ran to and fro, till he suddenly
uttered a growl.  He had found a man's bonnet.
</p>

<p>
"Paul Crubach was right&mdash;here is the badge of
Seaforth!" said Greumoch MacGregor, tearing a
tuft of deer's-grass from the bonnet, and trampling
upon it with vindictive hate.
</p>

<p>
"And there are the cattle-marks," added Rob
Roy, who had been scrutinizing the grass and heath
by the light of the moon; "cast loose the dog,
Callam&mdash;the caterans can have gone up the glen
but a little way yet."
</p>

<p>
The henchman let slip the leash, and the hound,
without hesitation, placed his nose near the grass,
and, uttering from time to time low growls of
satisfaction, proceeded up the glen at a trot, which gave
Rob and his armed companions, active though they
were, some trouble to keep pace with him.
</p>

<p>
All traces of habitation were soon left behind, as
the pursuers and their questing bloodhound
penetrated among the dusky mountains, entering on a
wild and silent region of sterile magnificence, above
which towered the double cone of Ben More.
</p>

<p>
On they went, through the lengthened expanse of
a glen that lay between two chains of barren hills,
at the base of which a river, rushing among
fragments of detached rock, foaming over precipices
and plunging into deep dark pools, swept onward
to mingle its waters with the Dochart.  The dog
went forward unerringly.
</p>

<p>
The hoof-marks of the hastily-driven cattle were
occasionally seen among the ferns, the crushed
leaves, the bruised stems and twigs of the wild
bushes; but for a time these traces were lost when
they entered on a great expanse of deep soft
heather, broken only here and there by a pool of
boggy water, which shone whitely in the light of
the waning moon: it was a tract of vast extent,
and all of a dun, dark hue.
</p>

<p>
Afar off, in the distance, rose the hills of
Glenorchy; and now, being somewhat wearied by the
long and arduous pursuit, Rob Roy and his men
sat down beside one of those great grey stones
which stud the Scottish hills and moorlands, marking
either the site of a Druid's altar, an old battlefield,
or a forgotten warrior's grave.  On consulting
his watch, Rob found the hour was midnight, and
that they had travelled about twenty miles, over a
road of unparalleled difficulty.
</p>

<p>
A dram from Greumoch's hunting-bottle revived
them a little, and then MacAleister led the bloodhound
in a circuit round the stone to find the scent
again.  These great tracts of heather are frequently
to be met with in Scotland, and concerning them a
singular tradition lingers in the Highlands.
</p>

<p>
It is said that the Pictish race were celebrated
for brewing a pleasant beverage from the heather
blossom, and that they usually cultivated great
tracts of level muir for this purpose, carefully
freeing them of stones.
</p>

<p>
On the extinction of their monarchy, and the
fabled extirpation of the whole race by Kenneth II.,
King of the Scots, after the battle of the Tay, two
Picts became his prisoners, a father and his son,
who alone knew the <i>secret</i> of manufacturing this
beverage.
</p>

<p>
Urged by promises of liberal reward, continues
the tradition, the father consented to reveal it, on
condition that first they slew his son, whom a
Scottish warrior thereupon shot through the heart
with an arrow.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said the stern Pict, "do your worst; for
never will I be prevailed upon to disclose a secret
known to myself alone."
</p>

<p>
A second arrow whistled through his heart, and
the secret perished with him.
</p>

<p>
It was on one of these moorland spots that the
MacGregors halted.  The eye could detect no living
object in the distance, and the wind brought no
sound to the ear, as by the great grey stone in the
wilderness Rob and his men sat listening intently,
and frequently with their ears close to the ground,
conversing the while in their native Gaelic, which,
though strange in sound and barbarous to English
ears, is, like the Welsh, a strong, nervous, and
poetical language, expressing the emotions of the
human heart almost better than any other in
Europe.  His followers were beginning to lose
heart; and fears that Colin's death might be
unavenged and the cattle lost were freely expressed.
</p>

<p>
"Remember the oath we have sworn, and neither
will come to pass," said Rob, with stern confidence.
"By the soul of Ciar Mhor, and by all the bones
that lie in the Island of the Cell, our swords shall
cross theirs before another sunset, or my name is
not MacGregor!"
</p>

<p>
"Four of the cattle are brown beasties of my
own," observed Greumoch; "and if they should be
lost, and Breadalbane does not see me righted, by
St. Colme, I'll bring off the Spanish ram and the
eight score of black-faced Galloways that are now
in his park at Beallach, though every Campbell
in Glenorchy puts his sword to the grindstone
for it!"
</p>

<p>
"And I will back you, Greumoch, though
Breadalbane is my own kinsman," said Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
"We are Campbells by day, oich! oich!" said
Greumoch, in a tone of singularly bitter irony,
which drew muttered oaths from his companions;
"but by night&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We are MacGregors like our fathers, and again
the sons of Alpine!" said Rob, starting to his feet.
"'S Rioghal mo dhream!  Forward, lads!  MacAleister
shouts to us&mdash;the bloodhound has again
got the scent."
</p>

<p>
The chieftain was right&mdash;the noble dog had
discovered the trail; and once more the pursuit was
resumed in a direction due north-west.  As day
broke, the distant hill-tops became yellow, and the
wild moor gradually lightened around them.  Rob
and his followers had just doffed their bonnets, in
reverence to the rising sun&mdash;a superstitious act, old
as the days of Baal and the Druids&mdash;when a fox
suddenly crossed their path.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot, MacAleister, shoot!" exclaimed a dozen
voices in an excited manner, for the son of the
arrow-maker was the best marksman on the shores
of Loch Lomond.
</p>

<p>
"But the creagh&mdash;the caterans!" he urged,
while unslinging his long Spanish gun.
</p>

<p>
"They cannot hear the shot, and, even if they
did, the fox must not escape."
</p>

<p>
MacAleister took aim and fired.  Then a cheer
of satisfaction burst from the MacGregors, as the
fox rolled over, feet uppermost, dead, about two
hundred yards off; and the pursuit was resumed
with fresh alacrity, as it was then a common Celtic
belief, that to meet an armed man, when proceeding
on a hostile expedition, portended success;
but to have your path crossed by a four-footed
animal without killing it, or by a woman without
drawing blood from her forehead, ensured defeat
and flight.
</p>

<p>
Roused by the report of the musket from their
lair among the green feathery bracken, more than
one red roebuck started up and fled towards the
desert of Rannoch, on the skirts of which the
MacGregors were now entering; and closely
following the footsteps of the hound, they drew near
the hills that bordered the vast sea of bog and
heather.
</p>

<p>
"Halt!" cried Rob Roy; "do you see that?&mdash;it
is another omen."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, a black carnivorous raven daringly
soused down upon a poor little lamb that was
cropping a patch of grass near its dam, and, in a
second, picked out his eyes.  As the lamb bleated
loudly, the mountain bird next seized and tore its
tongue, but a shot from MacGregor's steel pistol
killed them both.
</p>

<p>
"It foretells good fortune," said he, "and that
we shall soon pounce on the MacRaes, even as the
raven pounced on the lamb."
</p>

<p>
Greumoch proposed that they should light a fire
of dry heather-root and broil a collop from the dead
lamb; but Rob Roy, as he re-loaded and primed
his pistol, now detected a faint column of blue
smoke that rose at the edge of the moor; and,
after breakfasting on a little meal and water, he
ordered all to advance, but cautiously, towards it.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have our collop after we have
punished the caterans, Greumoch," said he,
good-naturedly.  "You remember what the Earl of Mar
said after the battle of Inverlochy, when supping
cold crowdy out of his own cuaran with the blade
of his dagger?"
</p>

<p>
"'That hunger is ever the best cook.'"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; so now, lads, forward again; and
remember the widow's son."
</p>

<p>
The appearance of some cattle grazing near the
smoke made the unwearied pursuers certain that
those they sought were not far off; but, after
drawing stealthily nearer, they discovered that the fire
was lighted to cook the food of a family of gipsies,
or itinerant tinkers, who were about to take to
flight on seeing Rob and his armed band approach.
On the former calling aloud that they came thither
as friends, the eldest of the wanderers turned to
hear what their visitors required of them.
</p>

<p>
MacGregor inquired if they had seen anything of
the spoilers.
</p>

<p>
"They passed us towards the hills, with twenty
head of cattle, only two hours ago," replied the
gipsy, "and, by the smoke that is now rising from
yonder corrie, I am assured that there they have
made a halt."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said MacGregor, with grim satisfaction.
"What is your name, friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Andrew Gemmil."
</p>

<p>
"You are a Southland man?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the wanderer, doffing his bonnet
with reverence, for the aspect and bearing of Roll
Roy awed and oppressed him.
</p>

<p>
"From whence?"
</p>

<p>
"Moffat-dale.  I will show you a track in the
hills that will lead you to the corrie unseen."
</p>

<p>
Rob promised the old gipsy two Scottish crowns,
and two silver buttons from his coat, if this service
were done.  Dividing his band into two, he led
one party straight up the face of the hill, on their
hands and knees; the other, under Greumoch,
guided by Gemmil, the gipsy, made a detour, for
the purpose of entering the corrie or deep ravine
on another point, and thus cutting off the retreat
of the marauders.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
HAND TO HAND.
</h3>

<p>
The autumn morning stole in loveliness over the
purple heather of the vast moor of Rannoch; the
blue hills of Glenorchy, that rose in the distance,
were brightened by the rising sun, and their
grey mists were floating away on the skirt of the
hollow wind.
</p>

<p>
The dark fir woods which then shrouded the base
of that great spiral cone, the Black Mountain,
tossed their branches in the breeze that swept
through Glencoe&mdash;the Celtic "Vale of Tears"&mdash;Dutch
William's Vale of <i>Blood</i>!  A blue stream
poured down the mountain-side, past an old grey-lettered
stone, whose carvings told of the deeds of
other times.  Many are these battle-stones over all
the Highland hills, for&mdash;in foreign or domestic
strife&mdash;every foot of the soil has been soaked in the
blood of brave men.
</p>

<p>
Creeping on their hands and bare knees, like
stalkers stealing on a herd of deer, Rob and his
men advanced up the mountain slope, dragging
their swords and Spanish guns after them.
</p>

<p>
The gipsy who acted as their guide was in front.
Thus they continued to ascend for three hundred
yards, and soon the sound of voices and of laughter
was heard.  Then came the unmistakeable odour
of broiled meat, and in a few minutes Rob Roy, on
peering over a ledge of rock, that was fringed by
the red heather, could perceive the party they were
in search of and their spoil.
</p>

<p>
Seated round a large fire of dry bog-roots, on the
embers of which they were broiling a road-collop as
it was named, were the twenty caterans, conversing
merrily, making rough jests on the MacGregors,
and passing their leathern flasks (containing
usquebaugh, no doubt) from hand to hand, in a spirit of
right good fellowship.  All wore the green
MacRae tartan, and conspicuous among them was
Duncan nan Creagh; near whom lay his long pole-axe
and brass-studded shield, on which was painted
a hand holding a sword, the crest of his surname,&mdash;for
this unscrupulous marauder was not without
pretensions to gentle blood.
</p>

<p>
His ferocious aspect was greatly enhanced by his
large and irregular teeth, which were visible when
he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I was right," said Rob in a whisper to his
henchman, who always stuck close to him as his
shadow; "'twas his fangs that left a death-mark in
the flesh of Colin Bane, the widow's son."
</p>

<p>
MacAleister levelled the barrel of his long gun
through the heather full at Duncan's head.
</p>

<p>
"Hold," said MacGregor, half laughing and half
angry; "I shall meet Duncan in open fight; but
take your will of the rest, thou son of the arrow-maker!"
</p>

<p>
The deep corrie or hollow wherein the caterans
lurked was shaped like a basin or crater, but was
open at one end.  At the other, or inner end, were
all the cattle; so Rob's plans were soon taken.
He knew that the conflict would be a severe one,
for the men of this tribe were so fierce and
tumultuary that they were, as we have stated, named the
<i>Wild MacRaes</i>; but the clan almost disappeared
from the West Highlands, when, a few years after,
600 of them enlisted in the Seaforth Fencibles, or
old 78th Regiment.
</p>

<p>
Greumoch, with the rest of his party, now
appeared creeping softly along the other side of the
opening, where they set up the shout of <i>Ard
Choille!</i>  This is the war-cry of Clan Alpine, and a volley
from five or six muskets formed the sequel to it,
and speedily altered the aspect of the carousing
party; for the whole MacGregors rushed on them
in front and flank, with swords drawn, and heads
stooped behind their targets.
</p>

<p>
With a thousand reverberations the jagged rocks
gave back the sharp report of the muskets and
pistols.  A yell rose from the hollow, and in a
moment the MacRaes, three of whom were bleeding
from bullet-wounds, were up and ready with sword,
dirk, and target.  Hand to hand they all met in
close and deadly strife, the long claymores whirling,
flashing, and ringing on each other, or striking
sparks of fire from the long pike with which the
centre of every target was armed.
</p>

<p>
Swaying his pole-axe, the gigantic Duncan nan
Creagh kept the sloping side of the corrie against
all who came near him, hurling every assailant
down by the ponderous blows he dealt on their
shields, till Rob Roy hewed a passage towards him,
just as MacAleister, by a fortunate shot from his
gun, broke the shaft of the cateran's axe, on which
he cast away the fragment and drew his sword.
While he and Rob eyed each other for a minute,
each doubtful where to strike or where to thrust,
so admirably were both skilled in the use of their
sword and shield, the strong cateran, who was a
head taller than his muscular assailant, laughed
grimly, and said,&mdash;"We have drawn the first
blood in this feud, Robert Campbell: so it is vain
to attack us."
</p>

<p>
"Coward! the first blood was drawn from the
heart of a poor boy," replied Rob; sternly; "and
remember that, though I may be Campbell at the
cross of Glasgow, or at the fair of Callender&mdash;yea,
or at the gallows of Crieff, if it came to that&mdash;HERE,
upon the free hillside, I am no Campbell, but a
MacGregor, as my father was before me, thou dog
and son of a dog!"
</p>

<p>
Again the tall robber laughed loudly, and said
with pride, as he parried a thrust,&mdash;"Beware, Red
MacGregor&mdash;I am a MacRae!"
</p>

<p>
"And wherefore should I beware of that?"
asked Rob, delivering another thrust which the
cateran received by a circular parry, that made
both their arms tingle to the shoulder-blade.
</p>

<p>
"It was said of the first of our name&mdash;<i>Bhai
Mac-ragh-aigh</i>&mdash;that he was the son of Good
Fortune, and his spirit is with us to-day."
</p>

<p>
"We shall soon see whether it is so, though I
believe that his spirit is in a warmer place than the
Braes of Rannoch," retorted Rob, pressing vigorously
up the rough stony side of the corrie, his
great length of arm giving him, when thrusting, a
superiority over his antagonist, whose blade he met
constantly by his target and claymore, so that he
seemed invulnerable.
</p>

<p>
A wound in the sword-arm now deprived MacGregor
of all patience.  He flung his target full at
his enemy's head, and grasping with both hands
his claymore&mdash;the same claymore with which his
father, the Colonel, slew Duncan of the Heads&mdash;he
showered blow after blow upon MacRae, whose
target soon fell in fragments from his wearied arm;
and the moment that protection was gone, Rob
closed in, and thrust his sword through and through
him!
</p>

<p>
Writhing his huge frame convulsively forward on
the blade, MacRae made a terrible effort to get the
victor within reach of the dirk that was chained to
his left hand, but suddenly uttering a shriek which
ended in a heavy sob, he sank down, to all appearance
lifeless, with the blood gushing from his lips
and nostrils.
</p>

<p>
This put an end to the fray, for all his followers
fled down the hill-side, pursued by the MacGregors&mdash;all
save one, a man of powerful form and ferocious
aspect, who was naked to the waist, and had his
kilt girdled round him by a belt of untanned
bullhide.
</p>

<p>
This Celtic savage, whose name was Aulay
MacAulay, flung himself upon MacAleister, who had
stumbled and fallen.  Seizing the henchman by the
throat with his teeth, he grasped Greumoch
MacGregor by the right foot, and with a fragment of
his sword, which had been broken, endeavoured to
despatch them both.
</p>

<p>
MacAleister strove vainly to release himself, and
Greumoch struck MacAulay again and again on the
head with his steel pistol clubbed; but finding that
he might as well have hammered on a log of wood,
he snatched a pistol from the belt of one who lay
dead close by, and shot the marauder through the
lower part of the head.  He yelled and rolled away,
biting the heather, and wallowing in blood; and
from this wild man of the mountains&mdash;for, in truth,
MacAulay was nothing better&mdash;that great literary
foe of the Celtic race, the brilliant historian of
England, was lineally descended.
</p>

<p>
Six of the MacRaes were left slain in or near the
corrie, and several of those who escaped were
severely wounded.
</p>

<p>
Alaster Roy and three other MacGregors were
wounded, and one was killed by a musket shot.
The cut on Rob's arm was deep, and, for a
time, required all the medical skill of Helen to
heal it.
</p>

<p>
It was thus that he avenged the foray of the
MacRaes, and recovered the cattle, which he restored
to their proper owners, who were poor cotters,
to whom the loss would have been a severe one.
All the weapons, ornaments, and spoil of the
vanquished he gave to the widow whose son had been
slain.  On the coat of one they found a complete
set of silver buttons, as large as pistol shot.  Such
buttons were frequently worn, even by the poorer
classes, in the Highlands in those days, and came
by inheritance through many generations.  They
were meant to serve as ornaments when living, and
as the means of providing a decent funeral, if the
owner fell in battle, or died far from the home of
his kindred.
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy received considerable praise for this
exploit, the scene of which was long marked by a
cairn, and Mr. Stirling, of Carden, and many other
gentlemen, whose estates lay near the Highland
frontier, and who had been neglecting to pay their
black-mail, now sent the tax in all haste to Inversnaid.
</p>

<p>
It was usually said of Rob that his sword was
like the sword of Fingal, which was never required
to give a <i>second blow</i>; but Duncan nan Creagh was
not slain, for such men were hard to kill.  He was
borne away by his followers, who returned on the
departure of the MacGregors, and bound up his
wounds; so Duncan lived to fight at the battles of
Sheriffmuir and Glenshiel.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
THE BATTLE OF GLENFRUIN.
</h3>

<p>
The preceding chapter will sufficiently have indicated
that the clan of MacGregor was in a state of hostility
with nearly all their neighbours, and that it
proved a source of disquiet to Government.
</p>

<p>
We will now proceed to relate how this state
of matters came to pass, and an explanation is the
more necessary as it will serve to show the <i>secret
spring</i> of many of Rob Roy's hostile actions,&mdash;why
he took up arms against the Government, and how,
from being a gentleman farmer and levier of
black-mail, he gradually became a rebel, an outlaw, and
yet a patriot, with a price set upon his head.  The
clan and surname of MacGregor are descended from
Alpine MacAchai, who was crowned King of
Scotland in 787, hence their motto, "<i>'S Rioghal mo
dhream</i>,"&mdash;"My race is royal!"  They are named
the Clan Alpine, and from their antiquity comes the
old Scottish proverb:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The woods, the waters and Clan Alpine,<br>
  Are the oldest things in Albyn.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Long before charters or parchments were known in
the North, their possessions were great; for they
held lands in Glendochart, Strathfillan, Glenorchy,
Balquhidder, Breadalbane, and Rannoch, and, until
1490, Taymouth, too, was theirs.  They had four
strong castles: Kilchurn, which crowns an insular
rock in Loch Awe, Finlarig, and Ballach, at the east
end of Loch Tay; an old fortress on an isle in Loch
Dochart, and many minor towers.
</p>

<p>
But when the kings of Scotland sought to
introduce into the Highlands the same feudal system
which existed in England, and in their Lowland
territories, and endeavoured to subvert the Celtic
or patriarchal law by substituting Crown charters,
which made chiefs into barons, who, in their single
person, thus became lords of all the land in which
their clan had previously a <i>joint</i> right and share,&mdash;a
right old as the days of the first settlers on British
soil,&mdash;a bloody strife ensued between those who
accepted such charters and those who refused and
despised them.
</p>

<p>
Feuds and local wars began, and all who resisted
the King were termed broken clans, and to be thus
stigmatized was tantamount to a denunciation of
outlawry.  By their sturdy adherence to the system
of their forefathers, the Clan Alpine soon became
eminently obnoxious to James VI., the meanest
monarch that ever occupied a European throne; the
more so, that in 1602, a long and bitter quarrel
between them and the Colquhouns of Luss (who
had murdered two wandering MacGregors) came to
a terrible issue in a place called Glenfruin.  Its
name signifies the Glen of Sorrow, and it is a deep
vale intersected by the Fruin, and overlooked by
ridges of dark heathy mountains, that are more
than eighteen hundred feet in height.
</p>

<p>
Here, then, on the 9th of February Sir Humphry
Colquhoun, of Luss, at the head of a great force of
horse and foot, composed of his own clan, the
Grahames, and the burghers of Dumbarton, under
Tobias Smollet, their provost,&mdash;met Alaster Roy
MacGregor of Glenstrae, who had only four hundred
swordsmen; but his superior bravery and skill soon
decided the disastrous conflict.
</p>

<p>
Glenstrae divided his little force into two parties.
Reserving two hundred to himself, he gave two
hundred to his brother Ian MacGregor, with
orders to make a long circuit, and attack Luss in
the rear.
</p>

<p>
This manoeuvre was most successfully executed,
and a dreadful hand-to-hand conflict ensued in the
narrow vale.  The Clan Gregor cast aside their
shields, and plying their sharp claymores, with both
hands clenched in the iron hilts, assailed both horse
and foot in front and rear, threw them into
confusion, and swept them in rout and dismay down
Glenfruin towards Loch Lomond.
</p>

<p>
Two hundred Buchanans and Colquhouns were
slain on the field, and though many of the Clan
Alpine were wounded in their furious charge, it is
remarkable that only Ian MacGregor and another
of the clan were slain.
</p>

<p>
They lie buried on the field, under a large block,
which is named "The Grey Stone of MacGregor."
</p>

<p>
A little rivulet near it is still named "the stream
of ghosts;" for there Fletcher of Cameron, a
follower of the Clan Alpine, is said to have
slaughtered a number of clerical scholars, who had
come from Dumbarton to see the battle; and it is
still believed that if a MacGregor crosses it after
sunset he will be scared by dreadful spectres.  Yet,
to preserve these boys from bullets and arrows in
the hour of battle, it is alleged that Alaster of
Glenstrae humanely enclosed them in a little church, the
thatched roof of which was fired accidentally by the
wadding of a musket, and they all perished in the
flames.  Others say they were all dirked by Dugald
Ciar Mhor, from whom Rob Roy was lineally
descended, and that he slew them like sheep, at
a large stone, from which the blood can never
be effaced.
</p>

<p>
Being mounted on a powerful horse, Sir
Humphry Colquhoun, minus sword and helmet,
escaped from the field, and fled to the castle of
Bannochar, where he was afterwards slain, when
concealed in one of the vaults, not by MacGregors,
but by some of the MacFarlanes, though the blame
of the deed was unjustly thrown on the former.
</p>

<p>
To James VI., his successor and friends made
a doleful report of the battle, in their own fashion,
and there came before that monarch, at Stirling, a
strange procession of eleven score of women, bearing
each, upon a spear, a bloody shirt, purporting
to be that of a husband or kinsman slain in
Glenfruin.
</p>

<p>
These females had been mostly hired at so much
per head, in Glasgow, for the pageant, and the
blood on the woollen shirts was that of a cow, bled
expressly for the purpose; but this melo-dramatic
exhibition was singularly successful.
</p>

<p>
James was so incensed that, without further
inquiry, he issued letters of fire and sword against
the MacGregors; and then the Colquhouns, the
Buchanans, the Camerons, and the Clan Ronald
joined with others, in a species of crusade, to crush
them.  They were hunted throughout the land, like
wild animals, but could never be suppressed; for,
whenever a MacGregor fell, the sword of another
appeared to avenge him.
</p>

<p>
Captured by treachery, Alaster of Glenstrae, the
gallant victor of Glenfruin, was ignominiously
hanged, at the cross of Edinburgh, with all his
nearest kinsmen, the sole honour awarded to him
being a loftier gibbet than the rest.
</p>

<p>
By an Act of the Scottish Legislature, the
surname of MacGregor was abolished, and they were
compelled to adopt others.  Some called themselves
Gregory and Gregorson, and some Mallet, of whom
the grandfather of the poet of that name was one.
Many took the name of Grahame, but many more
allied themselves with the powerful House of
Argyle, taking the surname of "the Great Clan;"
hence, a hundred years after the grass had grown
above the graves of the dead in Glenfruin, we find
Rob Roy designating himself <i>Campbell</i>, the name
of his mother!
</p>

<p>
The same Act ordained that none of the race of
Alpine should have in their possession any other
weapon than a pointless knife, wherewith to cut
their food; yet, in defiance of the Act, the Clan
Gregor went armed to the teeth as usual.
</p>

<p>
Bloodhounds were employed to track them in their
retreats; and their very children were abstracted,
and brought up in hatred of the blood they
inherited.  But the Celtic nature was soon averse
to such modes of suppressing a warlike and
time-honoured clan; and the Camerons alone maintained
the war against the MacGregors, who, on being
joined by the MacPhersons, met them in battle in
Brae Lochaber, and gave one-half of them a lesson
in charity, by cutting the other to pieces.
</p>

<p>
After the battle of Glenfruin, seven MacGregors,
who were pursued by a body of Colquhouns, came
over the mountains of Glencoe and Glenorchy, down
by the lone and lovely shore of Lochiel and the
birchen woods that border on the wild waters of the
Spean, till they found a brief shelter in the
farmhouse of Tirindrish, which was then occupied by
a Cameron.
</p>

<p>
Alarmed by the approach of the Colquhouns, they
fled again, and took shelter in a cavern, which the
Cameron, actuated either by treachery or timidity,
pointed out to the pursuers.  The toil-worn
fugitives were attacked with sword and pistol.  Six
were slain, and lie buried, where some pines, the
badge of their clan, were lately planted, in memory
of the event.  The seventh fled to a little distance,
but was overtaken, beheaded, and buried beside a
stream, where a friend of the author lately found his
skull, which the water had laid bare, by washing
away the bank, in which the other bones lie
yet embedded.
</p>

<p>
After their slaughter, the Colquhouns went back
to Luss; but the farmhouse of Tirindrish was now
said to be haunted from time to time by a headless
figure.  The Cameron became alarmed, and brought
thither a <i>Taischatr</i>, or seer, who saw it also&mdash;the
dim outline of a shadowy and bare-legged
Highlander, without a head, but with a remarkable
swelling on the right knee, a disease of which the
treacherous farmer had long complained; and hence
the seer intimated that the figure represented
<i>himself</i>!
</p>

<p>
It proved but the shadow of a coming event; for
soon after a party of MacGregors, true to the old
Celtic instinct of revenge, came to Tirindrish, and,
to punish the Cameron for having discovered the
cavern to the Colquhouns, struck off his head, by
order of Dugald Ciar Mhor.  The place where the
six fugitives perished is still named the MacGregor's
Cave, and a cairn was built there by the MacDonalds
in memory of the event.
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of such episodes followed the battle of
Glenfruin; and more fully to suppress the fated
surname, no minister of the church could, at
baptism, give the name of Gregor to a child, under
pain of banishment and deprivation; and the heads
of the Clan Alpine became a marketable commodity
under King William III., as the story of Duncan
nan Cean remains to testify.
</p>

<p>
Yet in spite of all these savage laws the clan
grew and flourished in the fastnesses of the Highlands,
and in the battles of Montrose their shout of
<i>Ard Choille</i> was heard farthest amid the ranks of
the routed Covenanters.  Hence the spirit of their
Gathering&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The moon's on the lake, and the mist's on the bay,<br>
  And the clan <i>has a name</i> that is <i>nameless</i> by day&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then gather, gather, gather, Grigalach!<br>
  * * * * * *<br>
  While there's leaves on the forest, or foam on the river,<br>
  MacGregor, despite them, shall flourish for ever!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then gather, gather, gather, Grigalach!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Hence in 1645 they could muster a thousand
swordsmen; a hundred years later seven hundred
swordsmen, and when the Highland regiment of
Clan Alpine was raised by the chief in 1799, one
thousand two hundred and thirty of the clan and
their kindred enlisted to fight for George III.
</p>

<p>
So little do tyranny and oppression avail in the
end!  They served but to bind Clan Alpine
together like bands of steel; but they were never
restored to their ancient rights, surname, or liberty,
till an Act of the British Parliament was passed in
their favour, <i>only twenty-four</i> years before the
regiment was embodied.
</p>

<p>
The wrongs of his name and kindred made a
deep impression on Rob Roy, and he thirsted for an
opportunity of seeing them righted, either by the
restoration of the House of Stuart, or by the
destruction of their more immediate oppressors.
</p>

<p>
He knew and writhed under the unjust laws by
which the whole clan, for the deeds of a few, so
long ago as the field of Glenfruin, were stigmatized
as cut-throats and traitors, and by which they were
nominally disarmed&mdash;the deepest disgrace that
could be inflicted upon a Highlander; by which
they were degraded in name and station, and
only permitted to live as Campbells, Grahames,
or Drummonds&mdash;a landless and broken race.
</p>

<p>
In his soul he longed for an opportunity of
avenging all this on the King and Parliament, and
for becoming a champion of the old Scottish
patriarchal system, and opposing the new, which made
feudal lords of Celtic chiefs, with power of gallows
and dungeon, over free men&mdash;but these were visions
wild and vain!
</p>

<p>
Proud of the past, however vague, the Red
MacGregor, like all his Celtic countrymen, believed in
the words of the bard, that&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ere ever Ossian raised his song,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell of Fingal's fame;<br>
  Ere ever from their sunny clime<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roman eagles came:<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The hills had given to heroes birth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave e'en amid the brave;<br>
  Who taught, above tyrannic dust,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thistle tufts to wave!<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And this belief in a lofty and warlike ancestry has
ever been the Highlander's greatest incentive to
moral character and heroic bearing.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
THE DEVASTATION OF KIPPEN.
</h3>

<p>
In the days of Rob Roy there were no police,
troops, or garrisons in his part of the Highlands,
and no law was recognized save that of the sword.
</p>

<p>
William III. had recently been placed on the
throne, and he exasperated the MacGregors by
restoring all the oppressive Acts passed against
them&mdash;Acts which had been cancelled for a time by
Charles II.  Thus they were again compelled to
assume other names than their own, or forfeit land,
arms, and all means of livelihood.  The memory of
William of Orange is still abhorred by the
Highlanders.  He was a king whose cowardice lost the
battle of Steinkirke, and by whose behest torture
was last judicially used, on Neville Payne, an
Englishman, in a Scottish court of law.  He
introduced flogging into the army, keelhauling into the
navy; "and he," says Sir William Napier, "is the
<i>only</i> general on record to whom attaches the
detestable distinction of sporting with men's lives by
wholesale; and who fought the battle of St. Denis
with the Peace of Nimeguen in his pocket, because
he would not deny himself a <i>safe</i> lesson in his
trade;" and he it was who, by his own sign
manual, condemned the whole inhabitants of a
Scottish valley to be slaughtered in their beds at
midnight, and this was <i>after</i> he had <i>ratified</i> the
Treaty of Achalader!
</p>

<p>
Hatred of this king and of those who adhered to
him determined Rob Roy to punish some of the
Whigs in his neighbourhood, and remembering
how active the Buchanans had made themselves
since the days of Glenfruin, he resolved to fall
upon them.
</p>

<p>
Assembling about two hundred men, and
attended by MacAleister and Greumoch, he
marched from Inversnaid towards Kippen, giving
out that he went "in the name of King James VII. to
plunder the rebel Whigs."  After a fifteen miles'
march, they halted for the first night on the
northern shore of the Loch of Monteith, amid the
thick groves of oak, chestnut, and ancient
plane-trees which flourish there.  They shot some deer,
lighted fires, and proceeded to cook and regale
themselves on the venison, with all the greater
relish that it belonged to their hereditary enemies
the Grahames of Monteith; and after posting sentinels,
they passed the night in carousing, and singing
those long songs still so common in the
Highlands, where the air and the theme have been
carried down, from the days perhaps of the Druids,
who, when seeking to cultivate the people by music
and poetry, framed their songs with long choruses
in which all could join.
</p>

<p>
And now, under the rustling leaves of the old
forest, the MacGregors, wrapped in their red tartan
plaids, sat round the glowing watch-fires, and made
the dingles echo, as they sang one of the ballads of
the female bard of Scarba&mdash;Mary, the daughter of
Red Alister.  Two hours before daybreak they
were all on the march again, and eight miles or so
further brought them, in the early dusk of the
autumn morning, to Kippen.  This village lies
within ten miles of the guns of Stirling Castle, and
for centuries it had belonged to the Buchanans.
Here the fertile valley through which the Forth
flows was studded with prosperous farms and
handsome country seats, surrounded by luxuriant crops
in some places, by the stubble-fields in others&mdash;a
rural scene, amid which the rocky bluff of the
Abbeycraig and the wooded summit of Craigforth
start up boldly and abruptly, with their faces to the
west; and Rob Roy took care to choose the time of
his invasion when most of the crops were stored in
the barn, and when the cattle and sheep were
gathered in pen and fold.
</p>

<p>
On the approach of the MacGregors, the old
castle of Ardfinlay (of which no trace now remains)
and the tower of Arnprior were abandoned by the
Buchanans, without a shot being fired, while the
village of Kippen was evacuated by its inhabitants,
who fled towards Stirling, with whatever they could
carry.  Carts and horses were now seized by the
MacGregors, and loaded with grain, food, furniture,
and whatever they could lay their hands upon.  The
cattle, horses, and sheep were collected in herds
and flocks; and after sweeping the parish, Rob's
men were about to depart for Inversnaid, with
pipes playing triumphantly in front, when a body of
men, armed with muskets and bayonets, swords
and pikes, appeared with drums beating, ready to
oppose them, about an hour after sunrise.
</p>

<p>
These men had been hastily collected and armed
by Sir James Livingstone, a gentleman who had
served in foreign wars, and who was resolved that
Rob Roy should not harry the district without a
blow being struck in its defence.  On the open
ground known as the Moor of Kippen, they came
in sight of each other.
</p>

<p>
Rob halted his men with the spoil they had
collected, and resolutely advanced to the front,
attended by his henchman, by Greumoch, Alaster
Roy, and a few others on whom he most relied.
By his bearing and the richness of his weapons, as
well as by his ruddy-coloured hair and beard, and
the two eagle feathers in his blue bonnet, Sir James
Livingstone recognized the Laird of Inversnaid, and
he also came forward from his line, attended by a
faithful servant, who was well armed.
</p>

<p>
Under his ample red coat, which was open, Sir
James wore a cuirass of polished steel; his hat was
cocked up by gold cord, and his full, white periwig
flowed over his shoulders.  Under the cuirass he
wore a buff waistcoat, which reached nearly to his
knees; he had his sword drawn in his right hand,
and carried a brace of loaded pistols in his girdle,
to which they hung by steel hooks.
</p>

<p>
"Have I the honour of addressing MacGregor of
Inversnaid?" said he, politely lifting his hat when
within ten paces of Rob Roy, who replied sternly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am MacGregor.  Had you styled me by
another name than that which my father left me,
I would have killed you on the instant.  And
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am Sir James Livingstone.  I have nothing
to do with the laws which seek the suppression of
your name and the destruction of your clan, save
that I reprobate them; but I demand by what right
you have broken the King's peace, and come hither
in arms to plunder a peaceful district?"
</p>

<p>
"For three sufficient causes," replied Rob; "first,
I have the old Highland right by which we can
at any time make a warlike inroad on our enemies,
which the Buchanans of Kippen and Arnprior have
been since that black day in Glenfruin; secondly,
I break the peace of him you name a king because
I deem him a Dutch usurper; and thirdly, I take
from cowards that which they have not the heart to
defend."
</p>

<p>
"I regret to hear all this," replied Sir James,
persuasively, "for there will be much blood shed,
MacGregor, if you do not yield up the spoil your
people have collected."
</p>

<p>
"Yield it&mdash;to whom?" asked MacGregor, loftily.
</p>

<p>
"To me."
</p>

<p>
"Little care we for bloodshed," said the other,
bitterly; "your foreign kings and Lowland laws
have made Clan Alpine like the Arabs of the desert,
whose hands are against all men, because the hands
of all men are uplifted against them.  Yet I,
personally, have no wish to slay any of your people.
You are a gentleman and a soldier, whose character
I value and honour; thus, if you choose, I will fight
with you here, hand to hand, with target and claymore,
in front of our men, and the spoil shall belong
to him who draws the <i>first blood</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Agreed," replied Sir James, sternly; "but,
though expert enough in the use of the sword, I am
unused to such a defence as the target."
</p>

<p>
"That shall be no hindrance," said Rob, as he
handed to MacAleister his round shield, which was
composed of triple bull's-hide, stretched over wood,
covered with antique brass bosses, and had a long
spike of steel screwed into its centre.
</p>

<p>
The friends of Sir James now crowded around
him, and bade him be wary, and remember the vast
strength of Rob Roy; the great skill he possessed,
the weight of his sword, and the advantage his
length of arm gave him over others.  These
warnings were not without effect on Sir James, who
was too brave to be without prudence.  He came
forward, and, lifting his little three-cocked hat, the
edge of which was bound with feathers, like those
of all the officers who served in King William's
wars, he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I agree to meet you, MacGregor, as a gentleman,
on the distinct understanding that the entire spoil
shall remain with him who is fortunate enough to
draw the first blood; but, as being the person
challenged, I claim the right to choose my weapon, and
for many reasons prefer the pistol."
</p>

<p>
"Be it so," replied Rob, laughing, as Sir James
divested himself of his glittering cuirass: "I am not
an old trooper like you, yet am a good marksman
nevertheless."
</p>

<p>
"Are your pistols loaded?"
</p>

<p>
"The pistols of a MacGregor are seldom otherwise,
in these times," said Rob, as his countenance
darkened; "and yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Are loaded, too."
</p>

<p>
"Shall we fire together, or toss up for the first
shot?" asked MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
"We will toss for the first shot, if you please,"
replied Livingstone, who, aware that he was a
deadly marksman, and had fought several duels in
France and Flanders with terrible success, had no
fears as to the result, if the lot fell to him.
</p>

<p>
"Then, Sir James, toss for me, but remain where
you are," said MacGregor, with indifference.
</p>

<p>
"And you will take my word for the coin&mdash;for
the result!" exclaimed Livingstone, with something
of admiration in his tone and face.
</p>

<p>
"Had I doubted your word, I would not fight
with you.  On equal terms I meet none but gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
A servant of Sir James, a man in livery, armed
with a musket, now came hastily forward to suggest
some trickery, which his master repelled with
scorn&mdash;even with anger.
</p>

<p>
He threw up the coin&mdash;a crown piece; it glittered
in the air, and then fell on the grass.
</p>

<p>
"A head!" said MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
"I regret to say it is not a head," replied Sir
James, touching his hat, while his cheek flushed
with triumph: "so I have won the first shot!"
</p>

<p>
A shout of anger burst from the MacGregors
on hearing this; but Livingstone's followers waved
their bonnets and clapped their hands in exultation.
</p>

<p>
It was strange, the scene which took place on
that morning, on the wide moor of Kippen.  On
one side the grim band of armed MacGregors,
in their red tartans, with drawn swords, Lochaber
axes, and long muskets, guarding the whole spoil of
the parish, and keeping together the herds of lowing
cattle and tethered horses, laden with bags of
bedding, and household utensils.
</p>

<p>
On the other, the well-armed retainers of Sir
James Livingstone, cross-belted and armed with
pike and musket; and midway between, the striking
and picturesque figures of the two combatants, who
were to decide the affray, standing about twelve
paces apart, with a pistol in each hand.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
THE DUEL.
</h3>

<p>
Sir James drew up his tall and soldier-like figure to
its full height, and buttoning to the throat his
long-skirted scarlet coat, the breast of which was covered
with broad bars of silver lace, he fixed his keen
dark eyes steadily on the figure of Rob Roy.  He
then levelled a pistol at the full length of his right
arm, and every eye was bent upon the muzzle from
which death was expected to issue.
</p>

<p>
Rob's coat was of rough, home-made, brown
stuff, destitute of lace or ornament; but his great
belted plaid of scarlet tartan filled up the eye.  His
pistols were bright as silver, and came from the
famous workshop established at Doune, so long ago
as 1646, by Thomas Cadell.  A silver chain
suspended his splendidly carved powder-horn, and his
dirk and broadsword were elaborately mounted with
silver.  Sir James covered him with his pistol and
fired!
</p>

<p>
A shout of rage and dismay burst from the
MacGregors, as Rob's bonnet was turned round on his
head, and, cut by the bullet, one of his eagle
feathers floated away on the breeze.
</p>

<p>
"That was a good shot, Sir James," said Rob,
smiling, as he replaced his bonnet; "an inch lower,
and there would have been one MacGregor less in
the world to persecute.  Under favour, sir, it is now
my turn."
</p>

<p>
Raising one of the claw-butted, steel, Highland
pistols, he cocked and levelled it straight at the
head of Livingstone, whose eye never quailed, and
whose gallant spirit never flinched.  Then suddenly
lowering the weapon, he said, "One cannot always
be a hero like Fingal, but one may always be a
gentleman.  I am, as you know, Sir James, a deadly
shot, and at this moment could kill you without
reloading.  I have no desire to slay men
unnecessarily&mdash;brave men like you, who may live to serve
their mother, Scotland, least of all!  In short, I
wish to spare you; but as the creagh must belong
to him who sheds the first blood, I must send this
bullet either through your head or your hand.  If
you prefer the latter, please to hold it up."
</p>

<p>
Scarcely knowing what he did, Sir James held up
his left hand.  Rob fired, and his bullet whistled
through the palm of the upheld hand, which was
instantly covered with blood, when Livingstone
uttered an exclamation of pain and suddenly
lowered his arm.
</p>

<p>
"We now part on the first blood drawn&mdash;your
own terms, Livingstone.  To the hills, lads!"
exclaimed MacGregor; "to the hills with the gear
of the Dutch king's rebel Whigs!"
</p>

<p>
A yell of triumph from the MacGregors rent
the sky, the pipes struck up "The Battle of Glenfruin,"
and the whole cavalcade moved off towards
the mountains.  But the matter did not end here,
for as Rob tarried a moment, to take a more
courteous farewell of his adversary, and to bind up
his wounded hand, Livingstone's liveried valet
levelled a pistol at his head.  Fortunately it flashed
in the pan; and MacAleister, who was close by, shot
him dead with his musket!
</p>

<p>
"Only one man, a servant to Sir James Livingstone,
was killed on this occasion," says the
statistical account; "and this depredation was
remembered by the fathers of several persons still
living, and is known as the 'Her'ship of Kippen.'"
</p>

<p>
It does not appear that any means were taken to
recover the cattle and goods thus carried to the
fastnesses of the MacGregors; but at this time the
whole Highlands, from the German to the Atlantic
Ocean, were full of those scenes of war and plunder
which succeeded the victory of the loyal clans at
Killycrankie, and the fall of their idol, the gallant
Dundee.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
ROB GOES TO ENGLAND.
</h3>

<p>
All hope of restoring the exiled House of Stuart
having ceased for a time, Rob Roy, for some years
subsequent to the establishment of the Revolution,
lived quietly on his estate of Inversnaid; only
assuming the sword to protect himself, his
neighbours, or those whose properties lay south of the
Highland frontier, and who paid the usual tax of
black-mail for that security of life and goods which
he and others afforded them.  He dealt largely in
cattle, and speculated so fortunately, that before
the year 1707 he had cleared the lands of Craigrostan
from certain bonds held over them by James,
Marquis of Montrose; and he generously relieved
the estate of Glengyle, the property of his nephew,
Gregor MacGregor, famous in Scottish history as
<i>Glun dhu</i>, or the Black-knee, from similar
incumbrances of a heavy kind; and being, by law, the
guardian, or, as it is termed in Scotland, the tutor
of Glengyle, Rob had great influence over the whole
clan, though nameless, broken, and scattered.
</p>

<p>
Rob and his gillies, clad in their red tartans, and
armed with sword, dirk, and pistol, and with a
target slung on the left shoulder, each carrying,
moreover, a heavy cudgel, driving some thousand
head of cattle, with pipers playing in front, to the
fair of Callender, or the Trysts of Falkirk, which
were then held on the Reddingrig Moor, and had
been so since 1701, presented an appearance so
animated, and an aspect so formidable, that few
cared to meddle with the Red MacGregor and his
followers.
</p>

<p>
Affrays were frequent at those fairs, and, indeed,
everywhere else in Scotland: political and religious
differences made men rancorous, and arms were
readily resorted to.  It was not until 1727 that the
Provost of Edinburgh prohibited wearing of pistols
and daggers openly in the streets of the city, for
brawls had become incessant.
</p>

<p>
"It may well be supposed that in those days no
Lowland, and much less English drovers, <i>ventured
into the Highlands</i>," says Scott.  "The cattle,
which were the staple commodity of the mountains,
were escorted down to the fairs by a party of
Highlanders, with all their arms rattling about them,
and who dealt, however, in all honour and faith
with their southern customers.  A fray, indeed,
would sometimes arise, when the Lowland men,
chiefly Borderers, who had to supply the English
market, used to dip their bonnets in the next brook,
and wrapping them round their hands, oppose the
cudgels to the naked broadsword, which had not
always the superiority.  I have heard from aged
persons who had been in such affrays, that the
Highlanders used remarkably fair play, never using
the point of the sword, far less their pistols or
daggers; so that a slash or two, or a broken head,
was easily accommodated; and as the trade was of
benefit to both parties, trifling skirmishes were not
allowed to interrupt its harmony."
</p>

<p>
King William having restored all the severe laws
against the clan, Rob was compelled to resume the
name of Campbell, when in 1703, his nephew,
Gregor Glun Dhu, who was likewise compelled to
call himself James Graham, was married to Mary
Hamilton of Bardowie, in the November of that
year, and our hero signed their contract as "Robert
Campbell of Inversnaid."
</p>

<p>
While he was acquiring wealth and popularity of
a local and peaceful kind by his frequent visits to
the Borders, his wife, Helen Mary, managed his
household at Inversnaid, and earned the reputation
of being a thrifty, active, and careful housewife.
Gentle in manner, and gently bred, she could play
the old Highland harp with great skill, as she had
been taught by Rori Dall, or Blind Roderick, who
was bard to MacLeod of that Ilk, and was,
moreover, the <i>last</i> harper of the Hebrides.
</p>

<p>
A Highland housewife had plenty of occupation
in those days.  The corn was then dressed in an
ancient fashion by the women.  The straw was
fired, that the heat might parch the grain, which,
though blackened, was gathered into the handmills,
or querns, and ground into meal or flour, just as the
Israelites ground theirs of old.  They had also the
management of the sheep.  No flocks were then
kept in the Highlands; but every family had from
the Hebrides a few sheep of a small breed, which
were never permitted to range the mountain but
were carefully housed at night.
</p>

<p>
In the household of Inversnaid the spinning-wheels
were never idle; hence there was plenty of
industry and comfort, but few luxuries.  All the
furniture was of black oak, or Scottish pine; the
only piece of mahogany being an oval teaboard, a
portion of Helen's "plenishing," when she left her
father's house at Comar.  On ordinary days her
dress was linsey-woolsey and a tartan plaid; and
though dignified with the title of <i>lady</i> in Gaelic, as
being the wife of a chieftain, and on certain
occasions, such as birthdays or anniversaries (the
Gowrie conspiracy, the Restoration, or the
imaginary succession of James VIII.), wearing silk and
fine lace, they were all made up at home, for in
those sequestered regions the name and business of
a milliner were unknown.  Of their five sons, only
four had as yet been born,&mdash;Coll, Ronald, Hamish,
and Duncan.
</p>

<p>
We are now rapidly approaching those events
which scattered Helen's happy household, and
drove her brave and trusty, generous and humane
husband "to the hillside, to become a broken
man," branded as an outlaw and traitor, with a
price upon his head.  King James VII. was dead,
and his son, though in exile, had assumed the title
of James III. of England and VIII. of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
In 1707 the English endeavoured to <i>force</i> the
Scots into a union; and, as a preliminary, very
unwisely seized all their merchant ships that were
in southern ports.  On this Scotland prepared for
war by strengthening her garrisons, and proposing
to raise sixty thousand infantry; so England
resorted to other means, and by bribery achieved
the measure so long desired.  Thus that which was
hitherto a weak and federal union, became a
powerful and combined one; each country,
however, retaining its own church and laws.
</p>

<p>
Before this great treaty was complete, the
Scottish Government restricted the importation of
cattle into England; but free intercourse being one
of the happy results of the Union, various persons
speculated in this traffic.  Among others, Rob Roy
engaged in a joint adventure with James, Marquis
of Montrose, who had received a sum of money for
his Union vote, and in the month <i>preceding</i> that
measure had been created a duke, with the office of
Lord Privy Seal for Scotland.
</p>

<p>
"The capital to be advanced," says Dr. Browne,
in his "History of the Highlands," "was fixed at
ten thousand <i>merks</i> each, and Rob Roy was to
purchase cattle therewith, and drive them to England
for sale."
</p>

<p>
The Duke's money he received from his factor or
chamberlain, John Grahame of Killearn, partly in
cash and partly in bills of exchange, drawn
through the Bank of Scotland on Grahame of
Gorthy.  He soon collected a vast herd, and leaving
his trusty henchman and foster-brother, MacAleister,
in charge of his household, departed for Carlisle.
</p>

<p>
The system of fosterage, which consisted in the
mutual exchange of children for the purpose of
being nursed and bred, was a custom peculiar to
the Scots and Irish, who were wont to allege that
there was no love or faith in the world like that
which existed between foster-brethren; so Rob
departed in confidence on his important mission
with a herd worth twenty thousand Scottish merks.
</p>

<p>
Prior to his leaving Inversnaid, Paul Crubach
had come there, and sprinkled all the cattle with
water from his holy well.  On such occasions he
was always provided with certain flint arrow-heads,
which he had found where a battle had been fought,
long, long ago.  These <i>elfshots</i> he duly dipped in
the water of his well, and then sprinkled it over the
herd to prevent any spell an evil eye, or another
elfshot, might cast upon them before they reached
the great market at "Merry Carlisle."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
THE GIPSIES.
</h3>

<p>
The trade of cattle-dealing was liable at that time,
as at every other, to sudden depressions and
miscalculations; thus, on his arrival at Carlisle, Rob
Roy&mdash;unfortunately for the success of the joint
speculation in which he was engaged&mdash;found the
southern markets, where Highland cattle had been
so long in great demand, completely overstocked.
Many other speculators were now in the field.  The
prices fell lower than they had ever been before,
and he was compelled to dispose of the whole stock
of cattle far below prime cost.  As his herds
diminished, he gradually sent all his drovers and
gillies home to the Highlands.  The last he
despatched was Greumoch MacGregor, with whom
he entrusted a letter (dated from an hostelry in
Castle Street, where he lodged) addressed to the
Duke of Montrose, detailing their mutual loss.
</p>

<p>
When the last cow was sold, Rob secured the
money which remained for the Duke and himself in
his sporan, as the pouch worn in front of the kilt is
named.  It was made of the skin of an otter, shot
by himself in the Dochart, and was adorned by its
face and claws, and closed by a curious steel clasp.
</p>

<p>
With his pistols carefully primed and loaded (as
the roads were then infested by footpads, mounted
highwaymen, and gipsies), he left Carlisle by the
Scottish gate, and in very low spirits took his
homeward way, mounted on a stout little Highland horse.
</p>

<p>
Carlisle was then, and for long after, girt by
walls and towers as a defence against the Scots,
whom the English could scarcely view yet as
fellow-subjects.
</p>

<p>
Without any occurrence he travelled about forty-five
miles, and on the evening of the second day
found himself entering Moffatdale, a deep and
pastoral valley, which is overshadowed by mountains
of great height, at the foot of which the Evan
and the Annan unite their waters in one.  The
sunlight had faded from the green summits of the Moffat
Alps&mdash;of Hartfell and Queensberry, and the deep
shady valleys were growing dark.  The night-hawk
was winging its way towards the lonely banks of Loch
Skene; the shrill whistle of the curlew as he rose
from among the green waving fern or purple heather
bells, and the coo of the sweet cushat dove in the
birchen thicket, were alone breaking the silence,
when Rob Roy drew his bridle near the village of
Moffat to consider where he should quarter himself
for the night.
</p>

<p>
He was in a strange place, and had about him
more money than he cared to lose.  There were
several ruins of old peel-houses, towers, and
cattle-sheilings on the hills, and in one of these a hardy
Highlander could sleep comfortably enough when
rolled in his plaid; but there was no necessity for
faring so roughly.
</p>

<p>
A meteor which shot across the darkening sky,
near the spire of a distant village church, made
Rob thoughtful; for it is an old Celtic superstition,
that when a falling star is seen by any one near a
burying-ground, it portends that death is near.  At
the moment he paused a cry of distress pierced the
air.  He listened intently and instinctively, and
drawing forth a pistol, glanced at the flint and
priming, to be prepared for any emergency.  Again
the cry reached him, and it seemed to be uttered
by a female in distress.  Urging his strong and
active Highland garron in the direction from whence
the cries came, he entered a deep and savage dell
named Gartpool Linn, where he beheld a very
startling sight.
</p>

<p>
A large and gnarled tree spread its broad
branches like a leafy arch above this dell, and
beneath them the last red gleam of the western
sky shone full into the hollow.  There an officer
and a party of soldiers were deliberately preparing
to hang four peasants on the lower limb of the old
chestnut.  At the foot of the latter, on her knees,
with hair dishevelled and disordered dress, there
knelt a young girl, who was alternately bewailing
the fate of the four victims, and imploring mercy
for them; and, from what she said, they proved to
be her father and three brothers.
</p>

<p>
In the oldest peasant MacGregor almost immediately
recognized Andrew Gemmil, the gipsy wanderer
who had acted as his guide when he followed
Duncan nan Creagh to the Braes of Rannoch.
Being single-handed, ignorant of the crime of which
the prisoners were accused, and finding himself
before eighteen soldiers and an officer, who were all
fully armed, and who by their jack-boots, buff
breeches, and blue coats, evidently belonged to a
Border militia regiment, Rob Roy stood by for
some time in bewilderment, and soon saw the four
unfortunates flung in succession off a ladder, and all
swinging and writhing in the agonies of death
between him and the ruddy western sky.
</p>

<p>
The officer now commanded his men to seize the
girl, who had cast herself with her face on the grass,
that she might shut out the dreadful scene; he
added they were to bind her hands and feet together,
and then throw her head foremost into the stream,
which then swept in full flood through this savage
ravine, and was all the more fierce and deep that
heavy rains had fallen of late.  Rob's blood began
to boil.  He thought, perhaps, upon the words of
Ossian:&mdash;"Within this bosom is a voice&mdash;it comes
not to other ears&mdash;that bids Ossian succour the
helpless in their hour of need."
</p>

<p>
Four soldiers tied her hands and feet, and were
about to obey the order of the officer, when Rob,
exasperated by such unmanly cruelty, commanded
them in a loud voice to pause, and then he demanded
sternly, "Why do you treat a helpless female in a
manner so barbarous?"
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that he was plainly attired in a rough
coat of Galloway frieze, with a tartan plaid thrown
over his left shoulder, and a broad blue bonnet
drawn down close to his eyes, and perhaps unaware
that he had a good sword by his side and pistols
at his girdle, the officer replied haughtily,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sir, you had better begone about your own
business, whatever it may be, less we add you to
the goodly company who await the crows on that
branch, if you dare to interrupt those who act in
the Queen's name and under her authority."
</p>

<p>
"Miscreant!" exclaimed Rob, "the good Queen
Anne never gave you warrant for such deeds as
these."
</p>

<p>
"Then the Lords of her Council do&mdash;so it matters
not to me."
</p>

<p>
"Who are these people?" asked Rob, firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Enemies of Church and State," replied the
officer, "and therefore they must suffer.  Throw
in the woman!"
</p>

<p>
"Hold, I command you!" exclaimed MacGregor,
with a voice like a trumpet, and leaping from his
saddle, he unsheathed his claymore.  The fury and
indignation which filled his heart added such
strength to his muscular arm, that in an incredibly
short time he had tossed eight of the soldiers into
the stream, and rescued the girl, waving his bare
blade in a circle between her and the rest, who
dared not advance.  Confounded by the audacity
of the man, by his sudden onslaught, and the
whole catastrophe, the officer remained for a
moment gazing alternately at the bold
intercessor, and at his men, who were struggling,
shouting, swearing, and scrambling to the river
bank as they best could.  With a slash of his
skene dhu Rob cut the cords which bound the
girl's hands and feet, and bade her "begone and
God-speed."
</p>

<p>
By this time the officer had rallied his energies,
and drawing his sword, attacked Rob, who instantly
ran him through the body, on which the soldiers,
believing that some large force of assailants was at
hand, fled without firing a shot, and left him in
possession of the field.
</p>

<p>
He then cut down those who had just been
executed.  All were motionless and still; but not
all dead, for ere long one who had been last thrown
off the ladder showed signs of life, and began
to revive.
</p>

<p>
Rob committed him and the girl, his sister, to
the care of the peasantry, some of whom were now
assembled.  He did more, for he carefully bound
up the wound of the officer, who was borne away
to the village; and then MacGregor, not knowing
how the matter might end, or of <i>what</i> the persons
rescued were accused, put some money into the
hands of the half-dead girl, and remounting his
horse, galloped through Moffatdale as fast as its
heels could bear him.
</p>

<p>
The author who relates this adventure of Rob
Roy, terms the persons who were executed "fanatics;"
but it is much more probable that they were
all Border gipsies, against whom there were then,
and for long after, laws in existence even as severe
as those which oppressed the Clan Gregor.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
INVERSNAID PILLAGED.
</h3>

<p>
On receipt of Rob Roy's letter, containing intelligence
that the cattle speculation had been a failure,
and that their money was nearly lost, his Grace
the Duke of Montrose burst into a very undignified
fit of indignation, and instantly summoned his
chamberlain, John Grahame of Killearn, who was a
remote relation of his own, and in every sense a
devoted and unscrupulous follower.
</p>

<p>
Poor Greumoch, whose rough and weather-beaten
exterior, with homespun Highland dress, with a
target slung on his back, all combined to gain
him but little favour with Montrose's pampered
valets, was speedily bowed out by them, and had
the door shut in his face, notwithstanding the
eagle's feather in his bonnet, which evinced his
claim, when on the mountain side, to be considered
a gentleman.
</p>

<p>
Then the angry duke laid the letter of Rob
before his chamberlain, who in the Scottish fashion
was simply named always by the title of his
property.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Killearn," said Montrose, grimly; "here
is a braw business!  Ten thousand merks nearly
have been made away with by this Highland limmer,
and am I to be at the loss of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly not, your grace&mdash;assuredly not,"
replied Killearn.  "Rob has property; there are
both Inversnaid and Craigrostan."
</p>

<p>
"Craigrostan&mdash;bah!  it is only a tract of grey
rock and red heather, where even the deer can
scarcely find shelter," replied the duke,
contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"But Inversnaid has a comfortable house, with
steading, barn, and byre, forbye garden and meadow
ground."
</p>

<p>
"Then, by heaven, I shall take Inversnaid,
though all that bear the surname of MacGregor
were on the hills to oppose me!" exclaimed the
duke, passionately.
</p>

<p>
Killearn seemed uneasy as the duke made this
outburst, and he twisted his well-powdered wig to
and fro, as if the heat of it oppressed him.  He was
a dapper little personage, who was always
accurately attired in a square-skirted coat, having
immense cuffs and pocket flaps, a long-bodied vest
and small clothes all of black velvet.  His cravat,
wig, and ruffles were always white as snow; he did
not approve of swords, and never wore one, though
for more than sixty years after this time every
gentleman in Scotland did.
</p>

<p>
In one huge pocket he carried a silver snuff-box,
and in the other a small thick breeches Bible,
which he produced on every occasion; for he was
one of those religious pretenders of whom Scotland
has always produced a plentiful crop.
</p>

<p>
To describe his face would be difficult; but it
expressed a singular combination of suavity, secret
ferocity, cunning, and meanness.  Montrose was
the chief of his name; hence Killearn regarded
him as a demigod, and all the more so because he
was a duke, and one who paid him well.
</p>

<p>
So between them it was arranged, that as Rob
Roy was absent&mdash;luckily for their scheme&mdash;possession,
in the meantime, should be taken of all the
moveables in his house and on his estate; that a
warrant for his apprehension should be procured,
and a reward offered for his capture by
advertisements in the Edinburgh newspapers.  Such
lawless and arbitrary proceedings were as easily
managed as proposed in those days.
</p>

<p>
"Take a well-armed party of my own people
with you," said the duke; "Rob has many enemies
in Dumbarton and the Lennox, who have long been
resenting his collection of black-mail, and you will
find plenty of hands willing enough to aid you in
driving his men farther into the hills.  There is
Stirling of Carden will help you if required; and I
dare say MacDougal's Dragoons could be marched
up Loch Lomond side, with the Buchanans of
Kippen; and," he added, with a sour smile, "perhaps
the Laird of Luss may move in the matter, if
he has not forgotten the battle of Glenfruin, and
the blood that yet stains the floor of a certain vault
in the castle of Bannochar.  See to this, Killearn,
and bring me news when all is arranged."
</p>

<p>
Killearn was somewhat aghast on hearing this
rapid sketch of a campaign in which he was to
figure as leader.  He had no desire to head an
armed raid into the MacGregors' country if he
could avoid it; but he resolved to proceed in
regular form of law; and in the duke's name he
did so, with marvellous rapidity.
</p>

<p>
All Rob Roy's farm stock and furniture, and
ultimately his house and estates, Inversnaid and
Craigrostan, were unjustifiably made objects for
arrest and sale; and while he was lingering in
Glasgow, endeavouring to raise money to repay the
duke, the "warrant of distress," as it would be
called in England, was enforced with great strictness
and even barbarity.
</p>

<p>
Another account of these proceedings would make
it appear that Rob was compelled to assign his
possessions in mortgage to the Duke of Montrose,
under a solemn promise that they should revert to
him when he could restore the money lost in the
transaction at Carlisle; that afterwards, when his
finances improved, he offered the sum for which the
two little properties were held in hand; but Montrose
and Killearn replied that, besides the principal,
there was now interest thereon, and various other
expenses, so that much time would be required to
make up a statement of the whole sum, and that,
in "this equivocal manner, he was amused, and
ultimately <i>deprived of all his property</i>."  Whatever
their proceedings were, of the <i>latter fact</i> there is
no doubt.
</p>

<p>
With a band of well-armed followers to support
the officers of the law, Killearn appeared at the
house of Inversnaid, when, fortunately for himself
and for those who accompanied him, the men of
the village were absent&mdash;some with the cattle on
the mountains, others cutting peat in the bogs;
some fishing in the loch, and others hunting in
the woods.
</p>

<p>
Rob's crops of barley, rye, peas, and small black
oats were all stored in his granary; and stacks of
dark brown peats, drawn from the bog on sledges
for winter fuel, were piled before the door.  The
young women of the village were busy carrying
manure to the fields in conical baskets, for now the
little wooden ploughs were at work on the upland
slopes; and the old people sat at their doors,
knitting, spinning, or basking in the autumn sun,
that poured his yellow glory down the rugged glen,
where the voices of the children rang merrily, for a
band of bare-headed and bare-legged urchins were
having a boisterous and gleeful game, with clubs
and balls, in the middle of the clachan, when, to
the terror of all, John Grahame of Killearn appeared
with his followers.
</p>

<p>
He had come up Loch Lomond, with one or two
large boats, armed with brass swivel-guns,
accompanied by several of the Buchanans, and, as some
say, by Stirling of Carden, who hated Rob Roy,
and dreaded him too, as he had long and unjustly
withheld the tax of black-mail.
</p>

<p>
With all his duplicity and cunning, Killearn must
have been a bold fellow in attempting to enforce,
in those days of dirks and broadswords&mdash;and more
especially in the country of Rob Roy&mdash;the same
harsh measures which similar factors carry out so
successfully among the now unarmed population of
the North; spreading desolation through Rossshire,
Sutherland, and Breadalbane.  Yet, anomalous
as it may appear, he did so.  It is said that on
the night before this visit, Rob's staghounds howled
in a melancholy and ominous manner, for the old
grey Highland dog possesses a sagacity so
remarkable, and an attachment so strong for
his master, that the people believe he can
foresee approaching evil and death with the eyes
of a seer.
</p>

<p>
Of the interview which took place bekveen
Mr. Grahame and Helen MacGregor, only traditional
accounts have been preserved; but all who have
written on the subject assert that he forcibly
entered the house of Inversnaid, and roughly and
summarily expelled her, with her four children and
all her servants; and that his bearing was harsh,
brutal, and unjustifiable.
</p>

<p>
"Grahame of Killearn," says the "History of
Stirlingshire," "over-zealous in his master's service,
had recourse to a mode of expulsion inconsistent
with the rights of humanity, by insulting
Mrs. Campbell in her husband's absence."
</p>

<p>
The furniture, crops, farm-stock, food, clothing,
and everything were carried off to be sold at
Glasgow or Dumbarton, and the door of the empty
house was closed upon the now homeless family.
The poor huts of Greumoch, Alaster Roy, and their
more immediate followers, were burned or levelled,
that they too might be without shelter; and
re-embarking, after achieving these outrageous
proceedings, Killearn, with all his plunder, spread
his sails, and proceeded down Loch Lomond with
all speed.
</p>

<p>
More than once the long Spanish gun of Rob's
foster-brother covered the dapper figure of the
duke's chamberlain; but Greumoch arrested the
weapon, and bade him tarry in his vengeance till
the Red MacGregor returned.
</p>

<p>
On beholding the total ruin of her household,
Helen MacGregoi is said to have cast her plaid
around her little boys, as they shrunk to her side,
and exclaimed, in a piercing voice, "Oh!  St. Mary,
now with the archangels, look here!"  For a time
she abandoned herself to the wildest grief; then,
when thoughts more fierce and bitter came, she
wiped away her tears, and registered a terrible vow
for vengeance on their oppressors.
</p>

<p>
"It is certain," says Scott, "that she felt
extreme anguish on being expelled from the banks
of Loch Lomond, and gave vent to her feelings in a
fine piece of pipe music, which she composed, and
which is still well known by the name of 'Rob
Roy's Lament.'"
</p>

<p>
One of the children was sickly and feeble, and
thus they were all thrust forth upon the mountain
side, in the last days of autumn, when a Highland
winter, with all its severities, was at hand, and
when the forest of pine&mdash;the badge of their
name&mdash;would be their only shelter; so Helen longed for
the return of her husband, and for the vengeance
that was sure to follow!

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
ROB AND THE DUKE.
</h3>

<p>
Ignorant of what had passed&mdash;that the fire on his
hearth was extinguished&mdash;and that his household
had been driven forth like beasts of prey&mdash;Rob Roy,
after failing to procure in Glasgow a sum requisite
to gratify the avarice of Montrose, appeared one
afternoon at the residence of the latter, the castle
of Mugdock, which is nine miles distant from
Glasgow, and is situated in Strathblane.
</p>

<p>
The valets muttered among themselves of what
their titled master had done, and marvelled what
might be the object of this visit from MacGregor;
the latter, especially since his inroad into Kippen,
had been somewhat used to be treated with a
respect that was not unmingled with fear, so
the sudden interest his appearance excited was
unnoticed by him, as he was ushered into the
library.
</p>

<p>
The castle of Mugdock, now a ruin, was then a
regularly fortified tower.  It is of great antiquity,
and was protected on the east and north by the
water of a lake, which was drawn round it in the
manner of a fosse.
</p>

<p>
The central keep or donjon was surrounded by a
barbican, built so as to form an obtuse angle with
the latter, so that a cross shower of missiles would
protect the arched gateway from any besiegers who
might assail it, for <i>defence</i> was the first principle of
Scottish architecture in the olden time.
</p>

<p>
Through the grated windows of the library poor
Rob gazed wistfully down Strathblane, "the vale
of the warm river," as it is named in the figurative
language of his native country.  He could see the
wooded landscape stretching to the westward far
away, the gentle uplands, the pine thickets, the
shining lochlets and the winding stream; the
insulated cone of Dumgoaic, covered to its summit with
waving foliage, and in the distance, closing the
familiar view, the vast outline of Ben Lomond, that
overshadowed its lake of the Twenty-four Isles, and
looked down on Inversnaid, where, as he fondly
believed, Helen, their little ones, MacAleister, and
the household awaited his return!
</p>

<p>
Alas! how little he knew of all that had happened
there within the last few weeks; and as little
dared his titled host to tell him.
</p>

<p>
A step fell on his ear, as a person in high-heeled
riding-boots, with gilt maroquin gambadoes and
gold spurs, trod on the polished oak floor.  Rob
turned, and found himself face to face with the
chief of "the gallant Grahams," the Duke of
Montrose.
</p>

<p>
The latter was not a little startled on finding
himself, during such a crisis in their affairs,
confronted by a man of such known resolution as the
Red MacGregor, so he blushed redly to the roots of
his ample periwig.
</p>

<p>
He wore the square-cut coat with buckram skirts
and the long-flapped waistcoat of Queen Anne's
reign.  These were of dark blue silk, covered with
gold embroidery, and he looked every way the
great-grandson of the High Cavalier Marquis,
whose portrait, by Anthony Vandycke, in wig
and armour, with sword and scarlet baton, hung
upon the wall&mdash;the same great Montrose who
had been so cruelly butchered by the Covenanters
in 1650.
</p>

<p>
As the duke entered, he had in his hand a
newspaper, which he hastily crushed and concealed in
his pocket, changing colour as he did so, for that
identical paper was the <i>Edinburgh Evening Courant</i>,
containing the advertisement offering a reward
for Rob's seizure, dead or alive, a copy of which
Grahame of Killearn had just sent to Mugdock by
a special messenger.
</p>

<p>
Though armed with sword, dirk, and pistols, the
bearing of Rob Roy assured the startled duke in
an instant that his visit was not hostile, and that
he was ignorant, or as yet happily unconscious, of
the wreck of his peace and honour, the destruction
of his property, and the desolation of his home;
so Montrose bowed courteously with a courtier's
greeting.
</p>

<p>
"I salute you, gentleman," said Rob, as in
Gaelic there are no terms descriptive of rank.  The
duke, whose right hand was still buried in his
pocket, clutching the paper, as if he dreaded that
it would fly out and unfold itself, held forth the
other; but Rob drew back with a lofty air of
offended dignity, saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My father's son would not take the <i>left</i> hand
of a king&mdash;nay, not even of him who is far away in
France; God save and send him safely to his
own again!  And so, duke, why should I take <i>yours</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Please yourself, MacGregor," replied the duke,
with chilling <i>hauteur</i>; "but remember that I have
good reason to be offended."
</p>

<p>
"Offended!" echoed Rob, with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"You have used me ill."
</p>

<p>
"You got my letter from Carlisle by the hand
of my most trusted kinsman, Greumoch?" asked
Rob, hastily.
</p>

<p>
"A gillie&mdash;a drover," sneered Montrose.
</p>

<p>
"A <i>duinewassal</i> of the Clan Alpine, James
Grahame, name him as you will," said Rob Roy,
becoming flushed with anger.
</p>

<p>
"What is all this to me?" asked Montrose,
haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"Dioul!" exclaimed Rob, passionately; "did
you not get my letter?"
</p>

<p>
"I did."
</p>

<p>
"Then it fully explained all."
</p>

<p>
"It explained that being undersold in the southern
markets, or something to that effect, you had parted
with our cattle below prime cost."
</p>

<p>
"Far below it, as I can assure your grace."
</p>

<p>
"Well, MacGregor Campbell?"
</p>

<p>
"'Sdeath!  MacGregor only!" interrupted Rob,
whose fury was fast rising, and he stamped his
foot on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"I decline to bear my share in this loss, and have
insisted upon repayment of the <i>whole sum</i> originally
subscribed, with the interest due thereon."
</p>

<p>
"You have insisted?" repeated Rob.
</p>

<p>
"The affair is in the hand of my chamberlain,"
aaid the duke, evasively.  "I am not now to learn
the tricks of Highland drovers, and how your band
of landless reivers and broken sorners, who drove
those cattle south, are likely to serve me."  The
Duke made this offensive speech for the express
purpose of working himself, and Rob too, into a
passion.
</p>

<p>
"Montrose," said the latter, sternly; "those
whom you stigmatize as landless reivers and broken
sorners are better men than ever inherited your
blood, duke now though you be!  And if this
is the way you mean to treat me, by the Grey Stone
in Glenfruin, and by the souls of those who died
there, I shall not consider it <i>my</i> interest to pay
your interest, nor my interest either to pay even
the principal!"
</p>

<p>
"Dare you say this to me?" exclaimed the
duke, flushing with real anger; "to me, under my
own roof-tree?"
</p>

<p>
MacGregor laughed, and patted the basket-hilt
of his sword, put on his bonnet, and arose.  Saying,
"I would say something more if you stood on the
open heather, under the canopy of heaven.  But now
let us understand each other; big words never scared
MacGregor, and they are not likely to do so now.
I have but ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£200 to offer you, and yours it should
have been had you acted justly or generously; but
now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You will keep it, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, every God's-penny, and lay it out in the
king's service."
</p>

<p>
"What king?"
</p>

<p>
"Can <i>you</i> ask?" exclaimed Rob, with a glance of
surprise, that was blended almost with ferocity.  "I
mean King James VIII. of Scotland.  Queen Anne
is ill, so men told me in the south; the day is not
far distant when the flag will hang half-hoisted on
the walls of Carlisle; and the first news that the
Hanoverian Elector has landed in England will
make the Highland hills bristle with broadswords&mdash;yea,
bristle like a stubble-field!  The heather will
be on fire from Strathspey to Inverary, and this
ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£200, Montrose, the sum exactly for which, as men
say, you sold your country, when bribed to make
the Union, I shall lay out in the service of him who
has sworn to break it.  Ochon! the ills that are
coming upon us are a pregnant example of the folly
of a people allowing their fatherland to be the
property of kings!  Thus, ours succeeded to the
kingdom of England, just as they might have done
to a farm or a barony; but England being the
richer and the greater, they soon forgot the old
house in which their good forefathers lived and
died.  And now, Montrose, learn from this hour
that MacGregor is your enemy!"
</p>

<p>
The duke, who was too high-spirited to brook
being bearded in his own house, raised his hand
to the bell to summon his servants, but paused on
seeing the stern frown that gathered on
MacGregor's face, and that his right hand was on the
pistol in his girdle.
</p>

<p>
With a mock reverence Rob left his presence,
reached the barbican, mounted his horse, and was
soon galloping down Strathblane towards the banks
of the Enrich.
</p>

<p>
The duke's first intention was to have him
overtaken by a mounted party and made prisoner; but
he speedily dismissed the idea, for to waylay one
who had just left his own threshold would cover his
name with disgrace and reprobation throughout the
north; and, moreover, the castle of Mugdock was
uncomfortably near the Highland frontier.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he muttered; "'twere better that he
should fall into other hands than mine, and find his
way from thence to the castle of Dumbarton, or the
<i>kindly</i> gallows of Crieff," for so the Highlanders
ironically termed that formidable gibbet on which
so many a sturdy cateran has taken his last farewell
of the sun.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
DESOLATION.
</h3>

<p>
Full of his own thoughts, which were fiery and
bitter, and feeling fully resolved to challenge
Montrose to a combat, according to the laws of
honour and of arms, Rob rode fast along the eastern
shore of Loch Lomond: but darkness had set in
before he drew near Inversnaid.
</p>

<p>
Then his heart began to swell with other and
kindlier emotions as he pictured his home and his
household&mdash;his wife and their fairhaired children
welcoming him back; and already their voices
seemed to sound in his ears, and their smiling
faces to come before him.
</p>

<p>
The moon had risen, and shed its light upon that
lovely lake of many isles, on the vast shadowy
masses of Ben Lomond and its wondrous scenery,
through which the rugged pathway wound, overhung
in some places by gloomy pines, by impending
rocks, or the feathery sprays of the silver birch.
</p>

<p>
With scorn and defiance of Montrose, certain
emotions of pride and security swelled the heart of
MacGregor, as he rode on; for again he was at
home&mdash;in the home of the swordsman and shepherd&mdash;the
abode of the wolf and the eagle, where yet,
in the garb of old Gaul&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The hunter of deer and the warrior trod,<br>
  To his hills that encircle the sea.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
From some points Loch Lomond resembled a great
river, lying between lofty mountains, its bosom
dotted with isles that are covered with trees, dark
brushwood, or moss of emerald green.  Bold
headlands of rock seemed to jut forth in the water,
which shone in the moonlight like a sheet of silver,
and hills that were covered with wood filled up the
background.
</p>

<p>
And there, in the moonlight, lay the loveliest of
all Loch Lomond's green and woody isles, the
MacGregors' burying-place&mdash;the Place of Sleep,
Inchcailloch, or the Isle of Nuns, with its ruined chapel
and all its solemn trees.
</p>

<p>
The Red MacGregor gazed on it wistfully, for
there had all the dead of his persecuted clan been
gathered, generation after generation, ever since
the days of Donngheal, the son of King Alpin;
and now he whipped his lagging horse, and ere
long reached the narrow track which led to his
home at Inversnaid.
</p>

<p>
The stillness began to surprise him&mdash;no cattle
lowed on the hills, no dog barked or bayed to the
moon as she waded through the fleecy clouds, and
one or two cottages, whose inmates he knew, seemed
to have fallen in or been levelled.
</p>

<p>
A strange foreboding of evil stole into his
breast.
</p>

<p>
At last his own house, with its whitewashed walls
and its roof thatched with heather, rose before him
in the glen; but no smoke curled from its
chimneys&mdash;no light appeared in any of its windows, and
all was solemnly and oppressively still in the homestead
around it&mdash;still and silent as the islet of the
dead that lay in the shining lake below.
</p>

<p>
Dismounting, he led his horse by the bridle, and
was about to approach the door, when three
Highlanders appeared suddenly before him: one carried
a gun, and was fully armed; the other two bore a
dead deer, which was slung by the feet from the
branch of a tree that rested on their shoulders.
</p>

<p>
He with the gun came boldly forward, and
demanded "who went there?"
</p>

<p>
"The Red MacGregor," replied Rob, in Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
"Inversnaid!" exclaimed the three men, joyously;
and, dropping the deer, they almost embraced him,
for they proved to be Greumoch and two other
MacGregors, who were among his most trusted and
valued followers.
</p>

<p>
"What does all this mean?" he exclaimed;
"why is my house shut, and where are the
people?"
</p>

<p>
"Ask Montrose!" said Greumoch, fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Montrose!  I left him but a few hours ago in
Strathblane," replied Rob.
</p>

<p>
"And he told you nothing?"
</p>

<p>
"Only that I owed him money, and that this
money he would have&mdash;every penny.  But speak
quickly&mdash;Helen, the boys&mdash;what has happened?"
</p>

<p>
The resentment of Rob Roy was deep, fierce, and
bitter when he found that his house and homestead
had been swept of everything, and that nothing
remained for him and his family but an abode in
the woods or on the mountain side; and he uttered
a terrible vow for vengeance on Killearn and on the
duke his master.
</p>

<p>
Ponderous locks now secured the door of his own
house against him.  These Greumoch's gun might
soon have blown to pieces, and thus he might have
forced an entrance; or he might have repaired to
the house of his nephew at Glengyle.  But Rob did
neither; he simply desired Greumoch to conduct
him to Helen, who now had found shelter in a little
cottage&mdash;a veritable hut&mdash;in a glen at some distance;
and the first boding sound that reached his
ear as he approached it was the melancholy wail of
the bagpipe, as Alpine, the family piper, played
Helen's <i>Lament</i>, which we believe has never been
committed to paper, but has been handed down
from one generation to another.
</p>

<p>
The presence of his wife and children (one of the
latter sick and ailing, too), instead of soothing Rob
Roy, added fuel to the flame that burned within
him; and the alternate grief and energy of Helen
spurred his longing for vengeance on those who had
so foully wronged him.
</p>

<p>
Next, his followers crowded around him, detailing
their losses and insults, grasping significantly the
hilts of their swords and dirks, and gradually lashing
each other into greater fury, for hitherto they had
lacked but a leader, and now that Rob had returned
they expected him to march them at once against
the Grahams, or whoever might come in their way.
But Rob Roy had greater aims in view than the
mere gratification of private revenge; so he resolved
to be patient for a time.
</p>

<p>
"And when that time comes, Helen," said he,
with solemn energy, "I will lay the Lennox in
flames, and harry Mugdock to its groundstone.
There is not a house or homestead, a castle or
village, but I shall lay in ashes, between this and
the Trongate of Glasgow, unless my hopes and
measures fail me."
</p>

<p>
Helen answered only by her tears, and pressed
her sick baby closer to her breast.
</p>

<p>
"Woe to you, Killearn," said Greumoch, while
feeling the edge of his poleaxe; "if you fall into
my hands you shall have a short life!"
</p>

<p>
Next morning Rob placed Helen on a strong
Highland garron, and slung the children in two
panniers on the back of the horse he had ridden
from Glasgow.  Greumoch, MacAleister, and others
shouldered their long Spanish muskets, the pipers
struck up "MacGregors' March," and in this fashion
the family of Inversnaid departed to seek a wilder
part of the country, where, rent free, they might
dwell amid the hills.
</p>

<p>
Rob retired twelve Scottish (or twenty English)
miles further into the Highlands, but he still
remained upon what he considered his own territory;
and there, building what was termed a creel-house,
resolved to live in open war with, and defiance of,
the Duke of Montrose, who, by a regular form of
law, had now become, for a time, legal proprietor of
Inversnaid and Craigrostan!
</p>

<p>
In the wilds of Glendochart Rob began to frame
daring political schemes, which the protection
afforded to him by his kinsman, Sir John
Campbell, of Glenorchy, now Earl of Breadalbane,
enabled him to mature, and arms were collected
and hidden in secret places, and men were prepared
for the coming strife.
</p>

<p>
Aware that the Paper Court of Dunedin (as the
Highlanders disdainfully term the College of Justice
at Edinburgh) was not a place where a
Celt&mdash;especially a MacGregor&mdash;was likely to obtain
equity, when opposed to a powerful duke who
supported the Whigs, whose government Rob
abhorred&mdash;he resolved to set all law at defiance,
and, like a true Scot of the olden time, to confide
in his sword alone.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the seizure of all he possessed on
earth, the advertisements which appeared, again
and again, in the columns of the "Edinburgh
Evening Courant," stung him to the soul; for
therein he was stigmatized as a fraudulent bankrupt,
an outlaw, and robber&mdash;as if it was sought to
make him one, for the express purpose of destroying
him.  One runs as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"All magistrates and officers of his Majesty's
forces are entreated to seize upon Rob Roy, and
the money which he carries with him, until the
persons concerned in the money may be heard
against him; and that notice be given, when he
is apprehended, to the keepers of the Exchange
Coffee-house at Edinburgh, and the keeper of the
Coffee-house at Glasgow, where the parties
concerned will be advertised, and the seizers shall be
very reasonably rewarded for their pains."  (<i>Edinburgh
Courant</i>, No. 1,058.)
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Now, Helen," said he, trampling the paper
under foot, and then casting it into the bogwood
fire that blazed on the floor of their cabin, "by the
soul o' Ciar Mhor, our foes shall find that the days
of Glenfruin are come again!  Henceforward, all
is at end between us and the Lowlanders, and we
shall devote ourselves to war and death!"
</p>

<p>
When Craigrostan, the last of his patrimony,
was taken from him, MacGregor was so exasperated
(to quote Browne's "Highland History") "that he
declared perpetual war against the duke, and
resolved that in future he should supply himself with
cattle from his grace's estates, a resolution which
he literally kept, and for THIRTY years he carried off
the duke's flocks with impunity, and disposed of
them publicly in different parts of the country."
</p>

<p>
The historian adds that these cattle generally
belonged to the duke's tenants, who were thus
impoverished and unable to pay their rents.  He
so levied, at the point of the sword, contributions
in meal and money, but never until it had first
been delivered by the poor tenants to the duke's
storekeeper, to whom he always delivered a receipt
for the quantity he carried off.  At settling the
money rents, he frequently attended with a strong
band of chosen men, and giving receipts in due
form, pocketed the rents of Montrose, who soon
began to repent, in bitterness, that he had ever
molested Rob Roy.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
ROB TAKES THE TOWER OF CARDEN.
</h3>

<p>
The hills abounded with red deer, the moors and
forests with other game&mdash;the lochs and rivers
teemed with fish&mdash;the pastures of the Grahames
were full of cattle; thus, Rob and his outlawed
followers lived sumptuously in their mountain
fastnesses, whither none, as yet, dared to follow them.
</p>

<p>
Montrose and Killearn were, at that time, beyond
Rob's reach; so on Archibald Stirling, of Carden,
who had long withheld his tribute of black-mail for
service and protection rendered, fell the first burst
of his indignation.
</p>

<p>
It was on a day in the harvest of 1710, that he
marched about two hundred and fifty men, in hostile
array, with pipes playing, through the parish of
Kippen, after passing through the wild glens that
lie at the feet of Benmore and Benledi.
</p>

<p>
This force suddenly appeared before the castle of
Carden, which stood on an eminence or island,
formed by what was then a loch, but the bed of
which is now a rich green meadow, and its name
signifies "Caer-dun," or, the fort on the height.
No vestige of this castle remains now; though so
lately as 1760 a portion of the great tower was
standing.
</p>

<p>
Archibald Stirling was a high cavalier, who, two
years before, had been indicted for treason, for
having drunk the health of James VIII. at the
cross of Dunkeld, accompanied by the Stirlings of
Keir and Kippendavie, while swords were flourished,
trumpets sounded, and muskets fired.
</p>

<p>
On the occasion of Rob's visit, Stirling and his
lady were both from home, with many of their
servants.  No inroad was expected from any quarter,
and, as the drawbridge was down, the MacGregors,
who had been prepared to take the place by storm,
quietly took possession of the gates, spread
themselves over the whole house, and the contents of
the cellars and pantries were quickly investigated.
</p>

<p>
When the family returned, about sunset, they
found the gates shut, the bridge drawn up, and the
windows and bartizan full of grim-looking
MacGregors, in their red tartans, and bristling with
swords, axes, and long guns; while Rob's favourite
piper, Alpine, strode to and fro on the roof, playing
his invariable air of defiance, "The Battle of
Glenfruin."
</p>

<p>
Outwitted and alarmed, the laird tied a white
handkerchief to the point of his sword, and dismounting
from the saddle, behind which his terrified
lady rode upon a pillion, he advanced to the outer
edge of the moat, and waved thrice his impromptu
flag of truce.  On this the pibroch ceased, and Rob
Roy, with bonnet and feather, broadsword and
target, appeared at a window of the hall.
</p>

<p>
"What is the meaning of all this, MacGregor?"
asked the laird, sternly; "wherefore do I find
your people here, and my own gates shut against me?"
</p>

<p>
"Carden, remember the black-mail!" replied
the outlaw, with equal sternness.  "You have long
withheld the reward of that protection I once
afforded you; and you must yield it now, or see
your house burned to the groundstone."
</p>

<p>
"I will not yield you a shilling&mdash;nay, not a farthing
of it.  I am able to protect myself against all
reivers and thieves whatsoever."
</p>

<p>
"Our being <i>in</i>, and your being <i>out</i>, at present,
cannot look very like it," said MacGregor, laughing;
"and here shall we stay, Carden&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Till I rouse the Lennox on you, or get a party
of troops from Dumbarton.  Remember that
MacDougal's dragoons are lying at Kylsyth!"
exclaimed Carden, furiously, as he turned towards his
horse.
</p>

<p>
"Hold!" cried Rob, sternly, and the appearance
of MacAleister's gun, levelled from the tower-head,
made Carden pause; then a scream burst from his
wife, when perceiving that Rob held from the
window their youngest child, which he had taken
from the cradle, as she feared with some cruel
intention&mdash;perhaps to cast it into the lake!  Her
husband had the same dread, for he grew deadly
pale.
</p>

<p>
"MacGregor, hold!" he exclaimed; "hold, for
Heaven's sake, and spare my child!"
</p>

<p>
"Who spared mine, when you and Killearn came
like wolves in my absence, and made my household
desolate?  Though my youngest-born was sick and
ailing, you stood coldly by, while it and its mother
were driven forth, from my house at Inversnaid,
like the dam and cubs of a wolf; so if I am the
wretch that you and others seek to make me,
wherefore should I not dash this youngling at your feet,
or cast it into the loch?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment both father and mother were
speechless with terror and anxiety; but Rob was
too humane to torment them thus.  He laughed,
kissed and toyed with the poor child, whose plump
fingers played with his rough, red beard, and then
he resigned it to the nurse, who was well-nigh
scared out of her senses.
</p>

<p>
"MacGregor," cried the Laird of Carden, "unbar
the gate, and lower the bridge, and you shall
have your black-mail, every penny, with all
arrears."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well, Carden; now you speak like a reasonable
man, and shall be alike welcome to your own
rooftree, and to share with me a glass of wine from
your own cellar.  Admit the laird, Greumoch," he
added to that personage, who had charge of the
bridge and gate.  He then hurried down, and after
courteously assisting the lady to alight from her
pillion, he conducted her into the castle, where he
soon received the tax, granted a receipt for it
in legal form, and drawing off his men, marched
under cloud of night, and with all speed, towards
the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Since the battle of Glenfruin, and its subsequent
severities, the MacGregors had been a scattered
clan; but they now began to flock to Rob Roy in
such numbers that he soon found himself at the
head of five hundred swordsmen.
</p>

<p>
As the representative of Glengyle, his influence
over them was very great, and they all regarded him
as the man ordained by Heaven to avenge their
injuries on the Lowlanders; for a wrong done to
one member of a clan was a wrong done to all, as
they were all kinsmen, and related by blood.
</p>

<p>
Habituated to war and the use of arms, to a love
of each other and of their chief, a clan was endued
with what an historian terms the two most active
principles of human nature&mdash;attachment to one's
friends and hatred of their enemies.
</p>

<p>
"Thus," says Sir John Dalrymple, "the humblest
of a clan, knowing himself to be as well born as
the head of it, revered in his chief his own honour;
loved in his clan his own blood; complained not of
the difference of station into which fortune had
thrown him, and respected himself.  The chief in
return bestowed a protection founded equally on
gratitude and the consciousness of his own interest.
Hence the Highlanders, whom more savage nations
called savage, carried in the outward expression of
their manners the politeness of courts without their
vices, and in their bosoms the highest point of
honour without its follies."*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Memoirs of Great Britain."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the reward offered for his
apprehension, Rob Roy was often rash enough to venture
from his fastness alone, and into the very territories
of his enemies, for he had become openly an
adherent of the exiled House of Stuart, and deep
schemes were on foot for maturing the plans of an
insurrection; and the conduct of many of these
intrigues was committed to his care.
</p>

<p>
On one of these missions he found himself belated
one night near the village of Arnpryor, in the
district of Kippen, to which he had paid more than
one hostile visit, and where, consequently, he was
exposed to many dangers.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, he repaired to the village alehouse,
and found a gentleman named Henry Cunninghame,
the Laird of Boquhan, seated by the fire over a
bottle of claret, which cost only tenpence per
mutchkin, and was then a favourite beverage with
all ranks in Scotland.  He at once recognized
MacGregor, and they entered into conversation; but
some remarks which he made, either on the affairs
of the exiled king, or those of MacGregor, exasperated
the latter, who sprang up with a hand on his
sword, in token of defiance and quarrel.  Boquhan
was unarmed.  MacGregor could have supplied him
with pistols; but being the challenged party he
preferred the sword, in the use of which few in
Scotland equalled and none excelled him.
</p>

<p>
The goodwife of the tavern, fearing a brawl,
averred that she had not a single weapon in her
house; so the laird despatched a messenger to his
residence for a sword, which his wife refused to send
him, knowing well it was required for a duel or a
brawl; so daylight broke, and found them still loth
to part in anger, and still waiting for a weapon.
</p>

<p>
It chanced then that Boquhan espied an old and
rusty rapier in a corner, which had hitherto escaped
his notice.  He at once possessed himself of it;
Rob unsheathed his claymore; the tables and chairs
were thrust aside, and the combat began with great
fury.
</p>

<p>
It is stated that MacGregor soon discovered that
he had no ordinary antagonist in Henry Cunninghame;
and having no particular animosity to him,
and remembering, perhaps, how perilous to his own
clan his death, or even a severe wound, would prove
at that particular crisis, after a dozen passes or so,
he lowered the point of his sword, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Enough of this, Boquhan; I find you are brave
as you are expert, and I yield to you."  So he
sheathed his sword, and they parted good friends;
but Rob's enemies in the Lennox magnified his
prudence into a humiliating defeat.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
THE JACOBITE BOND.
</h3>

<p>
Roy Roy and those who adhered to him found
themselves tolerably safe in the land of the
Campbells&mdash;the more so as his mother was a daughter
of that powerful clan which had been at enmity
with the house of Montrose since the wars of the
Covenant, since the slaughter of the Campbells at
Inverlochy by the Great Marquis, and since the
invasion of Lorn by his cavaliers.  Fortunately for
Rob Roy, the mutual hate between the Dukes of
Argyll and Montrose was still as hot as ever.
</p>

<p>
The death of Queen Anne and the accession of
George I. soon brought political matters to a crisis
in Scotland, where the Jacobites had remained quiet
enough under the rule of a sovereign who was a
Stuart, and under none else could the union of the
two kingdoms ever have been achieved.
</p>

<p>
But now, a rising for her brother to succeed as
James VIII. of Scotland and III. of England was
resolved on, and a great meeting of Jacobite leaders
took place in Breadalbane.  The better to mask
their intentions from Government, it was entitled
a hunting match, though among the secluded hills
of the Scottish Highlands such a precaution seemed
somewhat unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
The chiefs and chieftains&mdash;among the latter was
Rob Roy&mdash;who assembled on the occasion, soon
ascertained each other's sentiments and the number
of men they could bring into the field; and ulterior
plans were soon resolved upon, while a previously
prepared bond, for their mutual faith to each other
and to the exiled king, was produced, and thereunto
each man appended his signature.
</p>

<p>
By some inexcusable neglect on the part of a
gentleman who became its custodian, this important
paper fell into the hands of Captain Campbell of
Glenlyon (an officer whose name was unfortunately
involved deeply in the Massacre of Glencoe), who
was then stationed in the garrison of Fort William,
near Lochiel.
</p>

<p>
Glenlyon retained the bond, and finding that
among the names appended thereto were those of
many who were his own immediate friends and
relations, he did not, for a time, mention its tenor
or even its existence; but the horror with which
he was regarded in Scotland, as the tool of King
William in the midnight slaughter of the
Macdonalds, had spread even among his own kinsmen;
and thus, when the Jacobite chiefs became aware
that a man of a character so unscrupulous held a
document that might give all their heads to the
block and their estates to fire and sword, they
became naturally anxious and alarmed, and a hundred
futile plans were formed for its recovery or
destruction.
</p>

<p>
The Earl of Mar, the chief of the Jacobite
leaders, turned to Rob Roy, who, although he had
affixed his name to the bond as "Robert MacGregor
of Inversnaid and Craigrostan," cared not a rush
personally about the matter, as he despised alike
the new king and his government; but on being
urged by others, whose fortunes were less desperate,
he resolved to undertake its recovery or perish in
the attempt.
</p>

<p>
To this he was urged by Sir James Livingstone,
who had been despatched to him by the Earl of
Mar, and who was the same gentleman he had
wounded after the devastation of Kippen.
</p>

<p>
Disguising himself, he relinquished the
picturesque garb of the mountains for a rocquelaure,
boots, and breeches, and rode to Fort William,
which is a strongly-built and regular fortress,
situated near the base of Ben Nevis, and at the
extremity of Lochiel.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the peril in which he placed
himself, for the advertisements of the "Courant"
still, from time to time, offered a reward for him
dead or alive, Rob contrived to pass the gates and
sentinels unnoticed or unquestioned, and obtained
an interview with Captain Campbell of Glenlyon,
who recognized him immediately, but dared neither
to discover nor detain him, as Rob was a near
relation of his own.
</p>

<p>
His visitor inquired about the bond which had
been signed at the pretended hunting-match, and,
to his rage and indignation, he discovered, after
long evasion, that Glenlyon, in revenge for the
contemptuous manner in which he was spoken of
by the Jacobites, had placed the document in the
hands of the governor of the garrison!
</p>

<p>
The latter was Sir John Hill, a brave and resolute
old Whig officer, who had been placed there so far
back as the days of Charles II., and had retained
his command during all the changes of the long and
stormy period that intervened&mdash;in fact, strange as
it may appear, he was one of the last soldiers of
Oliver Cromwell.
</p>

<p>
"And so this bond, which binds so many of us in
life and death to King James, is in possession of
Colonel Hill?" said Rob, with visible uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Glenlyon, with a malignant
expression in his light grey eyes; "and it shall be
forwarded in due time to the Secretary of State for
the information of His Majesty and the Privy
Council."
</p>

<p>
"Humph&mdash;His Majesty!" repeated Rob, with,
scorn in his eye and tone; "will it be sent soon?"
</p>

<p>
"Why do <i>you</i> ask, my friend?" inquired the captain.
</p>

<p>
"Because," replied Rob, with a smile, "as my
name is appended to it, I should like, with your
leave, kinsman, to get a little further into the hills,
as I know that the Lords of the Privy Council take
some interest in my movements."
</p>

<p>
"Kinsman Rob, situated as you and the
MacGregors are, it will not make much difference
now.  But in three days the bond will be sent
from this to the Governor of Dumbarton in charge
of Captain Huske."
</p>

<p>
"Does he belong to Argyle's regiment?"
</p>

<p>
"No; the South British Fusiliers."
</p>

<p>
"He will require a pretty strong party to march
with through the glens."
</p>

<p>
"He will have the usual escort," replied Glenlyon,
carelessly; for he did not remark the red flash of
triumph that sparkled in the eyes of Rob Roy, as he
took his leave, and lost no time in travelling over
the mountains, and reaching his now humble home.
</p>

<p>
Knowing that Captain Huske and his party must
pass through the last-named valley, Rob summoned
MacAleister, Greumoch, Alaster Roy, his oldest son
Coll&mdash;who could now shoulder a musket, and was a
strong and active boy&mdash;with fifty other MacGregors,
all men on whom he could depend, who had been
his comrades in every expedition of importance,
and whom he knew would stand by him truly "to
the last of their blood and their breath;"
accompanied by these he took up a position in a place
which commanded a view of the whole glen, and
remained there night and day waiting for his prey.
</p>

<p>
The grey smoke of the clachan of Killin was
visible in the distance from Rob's bivouac; and on
the other hand lay Loch Dochart, amid whose
lonely waters the scaup-duck, the water-rail, and
the ring-ouzel float, and where the long-legged
heron wades in search of the spotted trout.
</p>

<p>
Moated by these waters is an isle containing the
ruins of a castle, the ancient residence of the knights
of Lochawe.  Masses of trees almost shroud it now;
but once, in the days of its strength and pride, it
was stormed by the MacGregors during a moonlight
night, in a keen and frosty winter, when the
loch was sheeted with ice.  Constructing large
fascines of timber to shield them from arrows and
other missiles, they pushed those screens before
them, and on reaching the outer wall, soon became
masters of the place.
</p>

<p>
There, too, is a floating isle, formed by the
intertwisting of roots and water-plants.  Often it is
seen to float like a ship before the wind, with the
bewildered cattle which have ventured on it from
the shore, for its grass is rich and verdant.
</p>

<p>
With tales of past achievements and songs,
passing the whisky-bottle round the while, Rob and
his followers saw the third day drawing to a close,
before Alaster Roy, who had been scouting down
the glen, came in haste to announce that a red
English soldier was in sight!  This proved to be
the advanced file of Captain Huske's party.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
THE DESPATCHES CAPTURED.
</h3>

<p>
The summits of the hills, behind which the sun
was setting, were dark and sombre, while a ruddy
purple hue tinged those on which his light was
falling.
</p>

<p>
Concealing themselves among some tufts of high
fern and dwarf alder-trees, the MacGregors watched
the advance of those whom they deemed the chief
tools of their tormentors&mdash;the unsuspecting soldiers
of the line.
</p>

<p>
The brightly-burnished musket-barrels of the
men, and the pikes then carried by the officer and
his sergeant, were seen to flash and glitter as they
advanced through the deep hollow, along which the
narrow foot-track wound; and soon the bright red
of their square-skirted coats, and their white
crossbelts, breeches, and gaiters appeared in strong
relief upon the dun heather of the glen.
</p>

<p>
Rob counted that there was an officer, a sergeant,
and twenty rank and file.  From his ambush he
could with ease have shot down the whole party,
had he been cruelly disposed; but, that even his
enemies might not be taken unprepared, he ordered
young Coll, MacAleister, and the rest to keep out
of sight, but to start up at a given signal; and then,
rising from his hiding-place, he advanced alone
towards the marching soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of a fully-armed Highlander, with
sword, dirk, pistols, and target, excited no comment
then; for, on Rob drawing near, the officer coldly
returned his salute, and the sergeant inquired
"how far it was from thence to the head of Loch
Lomond?"
</p>

<p>
"About twenty miles, if you pass through
Glenfalloch."  The soldiers, who were a mixed party of
the 15th Foot and the South British Fusiliers,
muttered something which sounded very like oaths.
In those days an officer's escort accompanied
every Government letter or message through the
Highlands, as smaller parties were liable to be
cut off.
</p>

<p>
"It will be mirk midnight before you get half
way through the glen," resumed Rob, with a
mocking smile; "and people say that Glenfalloch
is haunted."
</p>

<p>
"By what?" asked the officer, who wore a Ramillie
wig, a three-cornered hat, and red rocquelaure.
</p>

<p>
"Spirits."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed&mdash;whisky, I suppose?" said the sergeant,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Loud voices are heard talking in the air
overhead, when nothing can be seen but the sailing
clouds."
</p>

<p>
"Voices!" exclaimed Captain Huske.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as if one hill-top was talking to the other."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  I can bid our drummer beat the 'Point
of War.'  I warrant he'll scare away all your
Highland goblins, even Rob Roy himself, whom I wish
was as near me as you are."
</p>

<p>
"You have had him near enough once before,"
said MacGregor, gravely, as he suddenly recognized
the officer, though some time had elapsed since
they last met.
</p>

<p>
"Hah&mdash;when?"
</p>

<p>
"In Moffatdale, where he gave you a lesson in
humanity, and in good manners, too."
</p>

<p>
"Zounds, sirrah, what do you mean?" asked
Captain Huske, cocking his hat fiercely over his
right eye, and stepping forward a pace.
</p>

<p>
"Simply, that he ran you through the body, as
he is quite prepared to do again, if you do not
instantly yield up your packet of despatches!"
</p>

<p>
The officer sprang back, threw off his rocquelaure,
and brought his pike to the charge; Rob parried
the thrust by his claymore, but he uttered a shrill
whistle on seeing the soldiers fixing their bayonets
and cocking their muskets.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot down the Highland dog!" cried Captain
Huske, choking with passion; but his soldiers
paused, for a yell now pierced the welkin, and fifty
MacGregors, armed with sword and target, and each
with the badge of his forbidden clan in his bonnet&mdash;a
sprig of the mountain pine&mdash;rushed down with a
shout of "Ard choille! ard choille!  'Srioghal mo
dhream!"  Perceiving that he was outnumbered,
the officer withdrew his pike, and by outstretched
sword-arm Rob kept back his own people, who
glared over their shields at the unfortunate party
of soldiers, who thought their doom was sealed,
and that a hopeless and bloody struggle was about
to ensue.
</p>

<p>
"Are you all robbers?" asked the officer, fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"No more than your citizens of London or
Carlisle may be," replied MacGregor.  "You
might be shot by a cowardly footpad on Hounslow
Heath&mdash;ay, or London Bridge, or in the High
Street of Edinburgh; but who there would stop a
band of armed soldiers as I this day stop you?
Here, in front of your men, sir, I will fight you,
with sword and pistol, or with sword and dirk;
whichever please you."
</p>

<p>
"Neither please me&mdash;I am a king's officer, and
may not risk my life, like a roadside bully, thus,"
said the captain, haughtily.  "Am I right in
supposing that you are the outlaw Rob Roy, for whose
capture a high reward is offered?"
</p>

<p>
"You are right; I am the Laird of Inversnaid,
and instantly require your despatches."
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"The service of his Majesty, King James VIII.,
whom God preserve!" replied MacGregor, lifting
his bonnet with reverence.
</p>

<p>
"I must either give up my life and the
despatches together, or the despatches alone," said
the officer, bewildered and exasperated.
</p>

<p>
"What you may do is nothing to me."
</p>

<p>
"But there is one of vast importance."
</p>

<p>
"The very one I wish, captain; so surrender it
at once, or I shall cut you and your men into
collops for the fox and the raven."  Captain Huske
opened the breast-pocket of his regimentals, and
unwillingly gave to Rob a large sealed packet,
addressed, "To the most noble Prince, James,
Duke of Montrose, Secretary of State for Scotland.
On His Majesty's Service."
</p>

<p>
Rob's eyes sparkled with resentment on seeing
the name of his enemy; but he tore open the
envelope, and taking out the well-known bond of
the Highland chiefs, restored the packet to the
English officer.
</p>

<p>
He then offered him and his men a dram each,
and marched off into the darkening mountains,
leaving the captain to proceed towards Dumbarton,
or return to Colonel Hill at Fort William,
whichever suited his orders or his fancy.
</p>

<p>
By this bold exploit Rob preserved secret the
plans of the forthcoming insurrection, and saved
from the scaffold, captivity, or exile, many brave
nobles and gentlemen, whom otherwise the merciless
Government of George I. would have seized
and destroyed in detail.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
ABERUCHAIL.
</h3>

<p>
Prior to the great Rising of the Clans in 1715,
Rob Roy was engaged as usual in several small
skirmishes and frays, in which his skill and strategy
as a leader were prominent; and he gained yet
more the reputation of being the protector of the
poor against the rich, and of the defenceless against
those who would oppress them.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the Duke of Montrose, he had
re-established himself again at Craigrostan, from
whence he never went abroad attended by less than
twenty or thirty well-armed men, including his
henchman and Greumoch.
</p>

<p>
These were his <i>Leine Chrios</i>, or body-guard.
</p>

<p>
Some of the Grahames of Montrose, and others
who were obnoxious to himself or to the cause of
the exiled king, he confined occasionally in a place
which is still named Rob Roy's prison.
</p>

<p>
This is a mural rock, the eyry of the osprey or
water-eagle, which rises to the height of thirty feet
on the north-eastern shore of Loch Lomond, about
four miles from Kowardennan.
</p>

<p>
Slung by ropes, he occasionally lowered them
from the summit, and after permitting them to
swing in mid-air for a time, would give them a
severe ducking in the loch below and compel them
to shout&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"God save King James VIII."
</p>

<p>
They were then permitted to depart amid the
laughter of his followers; and it must be borne in
mind that this was very gentle treatment when
compared with that to which the MacGregors were
subjected when captured by the same people.
</p>

<p>
As the old Highland proprietors or heads of septs
held their lands in virtue of an occupancy coeval with
the first settlement of the tribes in Scotland, and
consequently disdained to hold possession by virtue
of a skeepskin rather than by their sword-blades, in
later years, a system of suppressing the smaller
lairds by force of arms had long been pursued with
success by the house of Argyle in the west.
</p>

<p>
A powerful landowner of that name, who had
recently been created a baronet, seized at the
point of the sword a small estate in Glendochart,
and expelled the proprietor with all his family
and kindred.
</p>

<p>
MacGregor, who could not permit an act of such
injustice to pass unpunished, sent Greumoch with
forty men to the Braes of Glenorchy, with orders to
"bring this oppressor of the poor a prisoner
before him."
</p>

<p>
It was in the sweet season of spring, when the
lapwing came to the bowers of silver birch and the
green plover winged its way over the purple
heather, when the MacGregors departed on this
expedition; and being aware of the place and time
when their prey would probably pass, they concealed
themselves among the bleak granite rocks
of Ben Cruachin, a vast mountain, the red furrowed
sides of which&mdash;furrowed by a thousand
water-courses&mdash;rise above Loch Awe, and terminate in a
sharp cone.
</p>

<p>
Here stood the wall of a ruined chapel, founded
of old by a MacGregor chief, and through it a well,
deemed holy, flowed into a stone basin, under an
old yew-tree.  To the stem was chained an iron
ladle, by which the thirsty pilgrim or wayfarer
might drink, and at the bottom of the basin lay
little copper Scottish coins which had been dropped
therein as offerings, while knots of ribbons, rags,
and trifles decorated the boughs of the aged yew.
</p>

<p>
"A place of good omen!" said Greumoch, looking
around him; "for here it was that Clan
Alpine won the lands of Glenorchy, when there
were no paper courts in Dunedin, or redcoats in
Dumbarton."
</p>

<p>
It chanced that on a day in summer, King
David I., of Scotland, was hunting with Malcolm
MacGregor, the eighth chief of Clan Alpine, on the
side of Cruachin, when a wild boar, of marvellous
strength, size, and ferocity, appeared in a rugged
defile.  It at once assailed the monarch, whose
hunting-spear broke and left him at its mercy; but
instead of rushing forward, the boar retired to whet
its tusks against the rocks, so Malcolm craved the
king's permission to attack it.
</p>

<p>
"E'en do," said the king; "but spaire nocht!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Eadhon dean agus na caomhain!</i>" shouted
MacGregor, translating the king's lowland Scottish
into Gaelic, as he tore up a young tree by the roots,
and kept the boar at bay until he could close with
it and bury his long dagger in its throat.  At the
third stab he slew it.
</p>

<p>
To reward his courage, David granted him the
lands of Glenorchy, and, in remembrance of the
day, added to his arms <i>argent</i>, an oak-tree uprooted
<i>vert</i>, across a claymore <i>azure</i>, which every
MacGregor may bear to this day.
</p>

<p>
But now the Campbells were lords of Glenorchy,
and just as Greumoch had ended this legend of the
clan, which no doubt all his hearers knew before,
the great personage they were in search of rode
into the defile, when he was surrounded, and his
retainers were scattered in a moment.
</p>

<p>
On finding himself a prisoner, and knowing well
to whom, the baronet proposed a ransom; but
bribes were offered and threats uttered in vain to
Greumoch, who ordered the prisoner to be tied up
in a long plaid, which was slung over the shoulders
of Alaster Roy and another tall gilly; and thus by
turns, with two bearers at a time, he was conveyed
for about fourteen miles to a place called Tyndrum,
where he was brought before Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
This village is at the head of Strathfillan in
Breadalbane, on the western military road.
</p>

<p>
Rob upbraided the prisoner with his cruelty and
oppression, and threatened to toss him over the
rock into Loch Lomond, with a stone in his plaid,
if he did not restore the lands in Glendochart to
their original owner.
</p>

<p>
Paper was produced, a document was drawn up
and signed, by the tenor of which he and his heirs
renounced them formally and for ever.
</p>

<p>
He now hoped to be allowed to depart; but there
arose a cry of,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To the well! to the well! give him a dip in the
Holy Pool of St. Fillan!"
</p>

<p>
It was Paul Crubach who spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Be it so," said Rob; "if the water has not lost
its virtue, a dip therein may improve the Campbell's
spirit of honour, and prevent him from robbing the
poor again."
</p>

<p>
In spite of his earnest entreaties, the MacGregors
bore their prisoner, who feared they were about to
drown him, to the well of St. Fillan.  The whole
population of the village followed, and lame Paul
hobbled in front, chuckling and laughing, while his
eyes flashed with insane delight, his long grizzled
hair streaming in elf-locks on the wind, as with one
hand he brandished his wooden cross, and with the
other tolled vehemently the ancient bell of
St. Fillan, which in those days always stood upon a
gravestone in the churchyard.
</p>

<p>
After permitting his men to duck the prisoner
soundly, Rob procured a horse, and sent him
homeward with a safe escort under his son Coll; but
though these indignities were too great to be
forgotten, in followers Rob was too strong now
to be captured, even by the Campbells of Argyle.
</p>

<p>
For the forthcoming revolt money was requisite,
and Campbell of Aberuchail, taking advantage of
Rob Roy's outlawry, had long withheld his tribute
of black-mail, so, before returning to Craigrostan,
our hero resolved on levying it, and marching from
Tyndrum at the head of his followers, appeared
before the mansion of Aberuchail, the proprietors
of which had been baronets since 1627.
</p>

<p>
Having heard that the MacGregors had been
seen in motion in the neighbourhood, all the cattle
had been hastily collected in a dense herd within
the outer walls of Aberuchail tower, around which
there grew a fine wood of oak-trees that for ages
had cast their shadows on the Ruchail, which means
the <i>red-stream</i>.
</p>

<p>
A strong gate, loopholed for musketry, and surmounted
by a coat of arms with the motto, <i>Victoriam
coronat Christus</i>, was closed and secured as the
MacGregors approached, and all was still within,
save the lowing and bellowing of the cattle, so
closely penned within the barbican.
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy thundered with his sword-hilt on the
outer gate, in which an eyelet-hole was opened,
and thereat the porter's face appeared, with an
expression of anxiety and alarm, which was no way
lessened when he found himself front to front with
the keen eyes, the ruddy beard, and sunburned
visage of the Red MacGregor, whom he knew
instinctively.
</p>

<p>
"Is the laird at home?" asked the resolute
visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," stammered the gate-ward.
</p>

<p>
"Why does he not come in person when he
knows who are here?" was the haughty query.
</p>

<p>
"He is at dinner."
</p>

<p>
"What!  Is this Highland manners, to close your
gates at meal-time, when other men open theirs
wide, that all men may enter?  Is this the way your
master rewards those who protect him from thieving
MacNabs and broken men of the Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir James Livingstone, Sir Humphrey of Luss,
and several gentlemen are at dinner with him, and
I dare not disturb them," urged the porter, whose
orders were to keep out Rob at all hazards.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen!" repeated Rob.  "Whigs, probably,
plotting treason against King James.  Tell
your master that the Red MacGregor of Inversnaid
is here, without, where it is not his wont to be kept,
awaiting his arrears of black-mail, and that he shall
see him, even if the King of Scotland and the
Hanoverian Elector, too, were at table with him!"
</p>

<p>
After a time, the gate-ward returned, trembling,
to say that "his master knew no such persons as
either the King, the Elector, or the Laird of
Inversnaid."
</p>

<p>
"By the grave of Cior Mhor, Aberuchail shall
repent of this false whiggery!" exclaimed Rob, as
he took a horn from his belt, and blew a blast so
loud and shrill that the whole house and the woods
around it rang with echoes.
</p>

<p>
Then anew the cattle bellowed, and the porter
shut the eyelet-hole and fled, lest he might be
pistolled.
</p>

<p>
Four pipers now struck up the "Battle of
Glenfruin;" the MacGregors uttered a shout, and
assailing the gate soon forced it; for the <i>clach
neart</i>&mdash;the putting-stone of strength&mdash;which lay beside
it, was dashed like a cannon-ball upon its planks
by the most powerful of the band, till the barrier
crumbled to pieces before them; after which they
proceeded with drawn swords to goad and drive off
the cattle.
</p>

<p>
On this, the baronet of Aberuchail came hastily
to the door of the tower, and taking Rob Roy by
the hand, made many apologies for what he alleged
to be the stupidity of the porter, and led his unwelcome
visitor into the house, where, however, neither
Livingstone nor Luss appeared.
</p>

<p>
Then he handed him the "black-mail," for which
MacGregor gave his receipt; they drank a bottle
of claret together, and separated, to all appearance,
good friends.  The cattle were all left in the parks,
and the MacGregors marched back to Craigrostan.
</p>

<p>
But does it not seem strange that when Pope
was writing at Twickenham, when Addison and
Steele were contributing to the <i>Spectator</i>, and when
Betterton was acting at Old Drury Lane, this wild
work was being done among the Highland hills?
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
ROB ROY RETREATS.
</h3>

<p>
In January, 1714, Rob commanded 500 men among
the gathering of 2,000 Highlanders who, on the
28th of that month, fully armed on all points,
attended the great funeral of Campbell of Lochnell.
At their head were a pair of standards, belonging
to the Earl of Breadalbane, preceded by thirteen
pipers; for, in fact, this great Celtic funeral was
in reality a Jacobite meeting&mdash;the dead body having
been kept unburied for nearly a month, that an
assemblage of Cavalier chiefs might take place,
to consider and arrange during the march to the
interment and the feast that followed it, the
measures to be taken for a rising in favour of the
Stuarts.
</p>

<p>
After maintaining, as already related, a vexatious
predatory warfare against Montrose, who long since
repented bitterly his injustice to the unfortunate
Rob Roy, the MacGregors assembled in such numbers
under the latter that they began to threaten
the Western Lowlands, towards the lower end of
Loch Lomond, from whence, marching into Monteith
and the Lennox, they disarmed all whom their
leader deemed inimical to the cause of James VIII.
</p>

<p>
To have complete command of the great sheet of
water which lay before his rocky home, Rob seized
every boat upon it, and had them drawn overland
to Inversnaid, for the purpose of attacking or
cutting off a strong body of West country Whigs,
who were in arms for King George, and who were
marching towards Loch Lomond; for so greatly
were the operations of Rob dreaded that the
people of Dumbarton supposed he might come
upon them in the night to storm the castle and
plunder the town.
</p>

<p>
Exasperated on finding that he had pounced on
all their boats, the Whigs resolved to make a bold
dash for their recovery.
</p>

<p>
The volunteers of Paisley, Renfrew, and
Kilmarnock, were mustered and armed from the Royal
arsenal in the castle of Dumbarton.  A body of
seamen from the ships of war then lying in the
Clyde towed them up the river in long-boats and
launches, and on entering Loch Lomond the whole
force proceeded by land and water against Rob
Roy and the MacGregors.
</p>

<p>
These forces acted under the orders of
Lieutenant-General Lord Cadogan, colonel of the 4th
Foot, who had arrived that year in Scotland.  At
night they halted at Luss, the stronghold of the
Colquhouns, the hereditary foemen of Clan Alpine,
where they were joined by Sir Humphry Colquhoun,
chief of his name (and fifth in succession of him
who fled from Glenfruin), with his son-in-law,
James Grant of Pluscardine, who brought some
forty or fifty men of his clan&mdash;"stately fellows,"
says Rae, in his history of the affair, "in their short
hose and belted plaids (<i>i.e.</i> kilts), armed each with
a well-fixed gun on his shoulder, a handsome target
with a sharp-pointed steel about half an ell in
length screwed into the navel of it, slung on his
left arm, a sturdy claymore by his side, and a
pistol or two with a dirk and knife in his belt."
</p>

<p>
The man-of-war boats, which were armed with
brass swivel-guns, took all on board, and then
they crossed the loch.
</p>

<p>
From the high land above Craigrostan MacGregor
saw the advance of this force, which was
too strong for him to contend against alone; and
a stirring sight it must have been, on that beautiful
sheet of water&mdash;the large boats, full of men in gay
scarlet uniforms, their bright arms flashing in the
sun; and it would seem, that thinking to scare the
Highlanders, they beat incessantly on their drums,
while the seamen maintained a constant discharge
from their swivel-guns, the reports of which were
multiplied among the steep mountains by a
thousand echoes, as the whole expedition swept in shore
towards Craigrostan.
</p>

<p>
Rob and his men, who were concealed among
the rocks, the heather, and tall braken, high up on
the mountain slope, could scarcely be restrained
from rushing to the beach and making an attack
when they saw the family banner of Sir Humphry,
a saltire engrailed sable, crested with a red hart's
head, and his followers in their tartan, which is
blue striped with red; and each man wore the
badge of his name, a tuft of bear-berry in his
bonnet.
</p>

<p>
The union-jack that floated in the stern of each
boat seemed but a foreign flag to MacGregor, for
never had it waved on these waters before, and the
red-coated volunteers he viewed simply as invaders
and enemies; yet their strength was too great for
him to hope a victory if he opposed them.
</p>

<p>
"Oich, oich!" muttered MacAleister, and others,
as James Grant's boats, with his men in red tartans,
appeared; "here come Pluscardine and his
kail-eaters"&mdash;for being the people who first cultivated
that vegetable in the north, they were named "the
kail-eating Grants."
</p>

<p>
As the men began to leap ashore, with fixed
bayonets, and form into companies, young Coll
MacGregor could no longer restrain his ardour and
impatience, and levelled his gun over the rocks,
crying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A nis! a nis! a nis!" (now, now, now!) "E'en
do and spaire nocht!"
</p>

<p>
"Hold, son of mine!" exclaimed his father,
grasping his arm like a vice; "boy, would you
destroy us all, and, it may be, with us King James's
cause too?  Let us await our time, and be assured
it will come anon."
</p>

<p>
And so, seeing that a conflict would be useless,
he prudently drew off his men to Strathfillan, where
the Jacobite clans were forming a camp, prior to
their joining the Earl of Mar; while the invaders of
Craigrostan committed to the flames several thatched
dwelling-houses, and the smoke of the conflagration,
as it rolled along the mountain-slopes, added to the
wrath and mortification of Rob and his men, as they
retreated up the side of Loch Lomond.
</p>

<p>
While one party of volunteers pushed on the
work of destruction, others searched for the
missing boats, which they found far inland, at
Inversnaid, and drew from thence to the water.
Those which were useless they staved, or sunk, the
rest were all conveyed to Dumbarton, where they
were safely moored under the guns of the castle.
And so ended the first expedition against Rob Roy,
a history of which&mdash;as if it had been a campaign in
a foreign land&mdash;was published soon after, in the
form of a pamphlet.
</p>

<p>
Summonses were now issued by Government to all
nobles and gentlemen, either in arms or who were
suspected of being about to arm, including John,
Earl of Mar, and fifty-two others, one of whom is
designated as "Robert Roy, <i>alias</i> MacGregor."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
JOINS KING JAMES.
</h3>

<p>
The brave Earl of Mar had now unfurled the
standard of the exiled king at Braemar, as
lieutenant-general of his forces, and after sending the
"cross of fire" through the Highlands, in a few
days he found himself at the head of ten thousand
men, and half the peers of Scotland, with all those
chiefs and gentlemen who had signed the Bond of
Union, which Rob Roy had so luckily taken from
Captain Huske, in Glendochart.
</p>

<p>
Mar's standard was of blue silk; it bore a thistle
and the words NO UNION.
</p>

<p>
The Duke of Argyle, anxious to evince his
attachment to the House of Hanover, hastened
from London, to put himself at the head of his
own clan, tenants, vassals, and all the troops then
in Scotland&mdash;and a motley force they were, of
English, Dutch, Switzers, and Lowland volunteers.
</p>

<p>
That branch of the Clan Alpine which is named
the race of Dugald Ciar Mhor, was not commanded
by Rob Roy at this momentous crisis, but by his
young nephew, Gregor MacGregor, of Glengyle,
who was lineal head of the house.  Thus Rob served
under him.  Glengyle is best remembered in
Scotland by his patronymic of Glun Dhu, or
"Black-knee," from the remarkable spot, which his kilt
rendered visible, on his left knee.
</p>

<p>
He was but a youth when the insurrection of
1715 took place, so there can be little doubt that,
on most occasions, he would act under the eye
and advice of a captain so skilful and bold as his
uncle.
</p>

<p>
On the latter joining the insurgent camp in
Braemar, he was at once despatched by the earl
to Aberdeen, to raise in arms the descendants of
300 MacGregors, who had been forcibly conveyed
there in 1624 by James Stewart, Earl of Murray, to
fight in the feuds in which he became involved with
the Grants, MacIntoshes, and others.  In this
mission Rob was pretty successful, for the
popularity of his name, among his own clan and others
made him an excellent recruiting officer at this
crisis; and so little did he value the Whig Government
and their proclamations that he walked openly
about the streets of the Granite City, and on more
than one occasion dined with Professor James
Gregory, who was by descent a MacGregor, but
had thus altered his name to elude the Act which
proscribed it.
</p>

<p>
He joined the Earl of Mar in time to be present
with his clan at the great battle of Sheriffmuir,
where the insurgents met the king's forces led by
the Duke o' Argyle, who was then lieutenant-general,
knight of the garter, and commander-in-chief
of the troops in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
It is no part of our plan to give any history of
that indecisive battle, which was severe and bloody
to both parties.  Both armies wheeled upon their
centres, and each routed the other's left wing, so
that it is impossible to say with whom lay the
victory.
</p>

<p>
On that day, Rob Roy, who commanded a body
of MacGregors and MacPhersons, was accused of
unwillingness to engage.  His enemies went further,
and asserted that, not wishing to offend his patrons
the powerful Duke of Argyle and Earl of Breadalbane,
save for whom he would have been crushed
long ago by the Duke of Montrose, he remained
almost aloof from the action.  Lack of interest in
King James's cause, or lack of courage could not
be laid to his charge; yet on this great day the
conduct of Rob Roy was incomprehensible.
</p>

<p>
Scott relates in his History, that when ordered
to charge by one of Mar's <i>aides-de-camp</i>, he
replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If the earl cannot win the field without me <i>now</i>,
he cannot win it with me."
</p>

<p>
From this it may be supposed that he considered
the decisive moment past, and wished to spare his
men; but, it is said, that on hearing this answer, a
brave man of the Clan Vurich, named Alaster
MacPherson, cast his plaid on the ground, drew his
claymore, and called to the MacPhersons&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Advance&mdash;advance!&mdash;follow <i>me</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Halt, Alaster," said Rob, interposing; "were
this a question about a drove of sheep you might
know something; but as the matter concerns the
leading of armed men, you must allow <i>me</i> to judge."
</p>

<p>
"Were the question about the foraying of a drove
of Glen Eigas stots, the question with you, Rob,
would not be who should be last, but who should
be <i>first</i>," was the stinging retort of MacPherson.
</p>

<p>
This nearly produced a quarrel between them;
already their brows were knitted and their swords
menaced each other, even while shells were bursting
and shot of every kind were tearing up the turf
about them; but finding the inexpedience of coming
to blows when under the fire of an enemy, they gave
each other a grim smile, and exchanged their
snuff-mulls in token of amity, yet many of their men now
joined the MacLeans, who at this moment made a
tremendous charge upon the regulars.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of this clan in the field, numbering
800 swordsmen, is a memorable instance of
the power of the <i>patriarchal</i> system over the <i>feudal</i>.
</p>

<p>
The chief had lived for years a banished loyalist
in France, and their lands in Mull had been gifted
to the House of Argyle; yet, in opposition to the
latter, the whole fighting force of the clan were in
the field against the duke, their legal landlord, and
under their long-exiled chief, the venerable Sir
John MacLean, fought valiantly.
</p>

<p>
With the best born, the best armed, and the
bravest of the Clan Gillian in front, he led them on
three ranks deep.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he exclaimed, "this is the day we
have long wished for.  Yonder stands Argyle for
King George; <i>here</i> stands MacLean for King
James!  God bless him!  Charge, gentlemen,
charge!"
</p>

<p>
And with a wild yell, in which their pibroch
mingled, the clan rushed on, and the levelled
bayonets of the soldiers of the line went down
before their whirling swords, like straw before
the flames.
</p>

<p>
At that moment, through the smoke of the action
there rushed an English officer towards the
MacGregor's line.  His sword was broken in his hand,
and left him at the mercy of a gigantic Highlander,
who pursued him with a tuagh, or Lochaber axe.
He was bareheaded also, having lost his hat.
</p>

<p>
A stone caught the foot of this fugitive, who fell
almost at the feet of Rob Roy.  With a shout of
triumph the fierce pursuer uplifted his axe, and was
about to cleave the defenceless head of the Englishman,
when the stroke was arrested by the interposed
shield of MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
The man with the axe uttered a hoarse Gaelic
oath, and turned furiously on the intercessor; but
each drew back with an emotion of surprise that
seemed quite mutual.
</p>

<p>
He was Duncan nan Creagh, the tall MacRae,
from Kintail na Bogh, whom Rob believed he had
killed on the hills of Glenorchy, and who, on finding
himself now among the MacGregors, uttered a shout
of "Righ Hamish gu bragh!" and rushed amid
the smoke and carnage to rejoin the fierce MacRaes,
who, sword in hand, with the caber-feidh, or banner
of Seaforth, flying over them, flung themselves in
headlong charge upon the Swiss battalion of Brigadier
Grant, and hewed a long and terrible pathway
through it.
</p>

<p>
Rob now lifted up the man he had saved, and to
his astonishment found him to be Captain Huske,
the same officer whom he had last met in Glendochart;
so he sent him to the rear, a prisoner, in
charge of his son Coll, from whom the captain was
retaken a few minutes after by a detachment of
Captain MacDougal's dragoons.
</p>

<p>
This confused battle of Sheriffmuir, or Slia Thirra,
as the Celts name it, was claimed by both parties as
a victory; but Mar found himself compelled to retire
towards Perth, and to Rob Roy was assigned the
onerous task of guiding his army through the deep
and treacherous Fords of Frew, when they crossed
the river Forth.
</p>

<p>
For a time after this battle Rob and his
MacGregors garrisoned the fine old royal palace
of Falkland, which lies at the foot of the Lomond
hills, and the memory of that occupation still
lingers in Fifeshire; for they "harried the
pharisaical Whigs" to some purpose, laying the whole
country under military contribution for miles around
the palace, from which they retired at last with
considerable booty, and after a sojourn of several weeks
of jollity and ease.
</p>

<p>
Their shoes being much worn by marching, "they
did not scruple to strip the feet of any civic and
clerical functionaries with whom they chanced to
meet, and whom they consoled with the jocular
assurance that his gracious majesty James VIII. would
be happy to afford them full compensation."
</p>

<p>
As the honour and advantage of the battle
remained with Argyle, and as Mar's unpaid army
began to disperse from want of food and subsistence,
the insurrection soon came to an end, and the
Government acted with a merciless barbarity upon
the fallen.  Their severity was worthy of the orientals
alone, and in the hearts of the Highland youth a
hatred was instilled that found a terrible vent in the
future rising of 1745.
</p>

<p>
It was on the Lowland lords, however, that the
hands of the Ministry fell most heavily; for, by
retreating into their mountain fastnesses, the
Highlanders defied as yet all efforts at coercion.
</p>

<p>
The following story is told of Duncan-nan-Creagh
a short time after the battle of Sheriffmuir.
</p>

<p>
A tall and powerful Highlander, who had brought
a drove of cattle into the south Lowlands, sought a
night's shelter at the house of Captain MacDougal,
who, as we have stated, commanded a troop of horse
in that field.
</p>

<p>
The captain asked his Highland guest from what
part of the north he came?
</p>

<p>
"Kintail na Bogh," replied the other, with some
reserve.
</p>

<p>
"Know you a place called Corrie Choing?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, captain; but why do you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you," replied the officer; "after the
battle, accompanied by two of the best men of my
troop, I overtook a strong and athletic Highlander,
who by the blood on his tartans and the white rose
in his bonnet, had evidently stood by King James
on that unhappy day.  As we came up at a canter
he took off his plaid, folded it with great deliberation,
placed it on the ground, and then he stood upon it
to give him firmer footing.  I was anxious to take
this man prisoner, so we three rode round him in a
circle, with our swords brandished; but one who
unfortunately and unwisely ventured within reach
of the clansman's sword, was cloven through his
grenadier cap and slain.  He slew the other, on
which, sooth to say, I thought he had fairly earned
his life and liberty, and so left him to his fate,
simply asking him his name, and saying that he
was a brave fellow.  'I am from Corrie Choing,'
said he; 'but my name I may not tell you.'"
</p>

<p>
"I know him well, captain," said the drover;
"we call him Duncan Mhor nan Creagh."
</p>

<p>
"The wars are over now, thank Heaven, and I
wish him no harm," replied MacDougal, "for he is
a brave and resolute fellow."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be sure to tell him so," said the drover,
as he departed; but warily kept his own council,
for he was no other than the identical Big Duncan
of the Forays, from whom Rob Roy had saved
Captain Huske during the battle of Sheriffmuir.
</p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br><br>
INVERSNAID GARRISONED.
</h3>

<p>
After the close of the whole insurrection, when
the leaders of it were in their bloody graves or in
hopeless exile, seeking in foreign camps and fields
their bread at the point of the sword, the old
rancorous sentiment against the Clan Alpine was still
found to exist; for in the subsequent Act of
Indemnity a free pardon was granted to all Jacobites,
"<i>excepting persons of the name of MacGregor</i>,
mentioned in an Act, made in Scotland in the first year
of King Charles I., intituled 'Anent the Clan
Gregor,' whatever name he or they may have, or do
<i>assume</i>;" and hence especially among the proscribed
appeared the now dreaded name of "Robert
Campbell, <i>alias</i> MacGregor, <i>commonly</i> called Robert
Roy."
</p>

<p>
This insulting mode of designating him, as if he
had been a common thief in the "Hue and Cry,"
embittered yet more the soul of MacGregor; though
he had been so long outlawed, and subjected to
every severity and danger, this new act made little
difference circumstantially to Rob, and doubtless he
despised it.  But the erection of a government
fortress and barrack on <i>his own lands</i> of Inversnaid,
for the direct purpose of overawing and subjugating
his clan, and to lay him and it more completely at
the mercy of the Whigs and Montrose, was more
than he could suffer with patience.
</p>

<p>
His house of Auchinchisallan, in which he had
resided in Breadalbane, had been wantonly burned,
and his wife and children were once more driven to
the caves and rocks for shelter; his cattle and
crops were seized by a party of troops specially
sent for those purposes by General Charles Lord
Cadogan, an officer who had served as a brigadier
under Marlborough, who had been taken prisoner
at the siege of Messina, in 1706, and who was made
Master-General of the Ordnance in 1722.
</p>

<p>
On MacGregor's lands he exercised great severity;
and now, separated from his wife and children, the
unfortunate Rob Roy, attended by his faithful
henchman and foster-brother, Callam MacAleister,
lurked in the mountains, and chiefly in the cavern
near Loch Lomond, which still bears his name, and
from whence he could see the flames of rapine and
destruction, as the country was swept by fire and
sword; and there he schemed out many a futile
plan of vengeance on his oppressors.
</p>

<p>
Amid all this his heart bled for his children, who
were growing up to desperate lives and wayward
fortunes, the end of which he could not foresee.
One thing, however, his own sense predicted: that
the life of war and hazard he now lead could not
last for ever, and that the erection of forts in the
Highlands, and the entrance of war ships into the
great salt lochs by which they were intersected,
might ultimately curb the power of the Jacobite
clans, especially when the overwhelming strength of
the Campbells, the Grants, and other Whig clans,
was united to that of the Lowland invader; and
ultimately&mdash;but not in Rob's time&mdash;this prediction
of his soul came true.
</p>

<p>
And yet it was for his children, and the patrimony
which had been rent from them, that he maintained
a hopeless struggle with their oppressors.  It has
been well observed by a modern writer, "that the
motives to exertion furnished by the possession of
children are as powerful as ever moved heart or
hand.  The secret of many a struggle in life's battle
may be found at home.  The man who has children
dependent upon him will and must struggle manfully
against the most adverse circumstances.  The
thought that the joy of their innocent young lives
depends upon his courage, his perseverance, his
energy&mdash;this thought will enable him to work
wonders, and achieve what will appear impossibilities
to the man who has only his own selfish
needs and his own selfish ambition to urge him
on."  And so, when poor MacGregor thought of the
<i>future</i> of his boys, his otherwise unflinching heart
was rent in twain.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the erection of the government fortress
at Inversnaid proceeded rapidly, though he
did all in his power to retard it; and he had the
mortification to see the stones of his own dwelling-house
and of the cottages of his tenantry used in
construction of the barrack and bastions.
</p>

<p>
A builder named Naysmith, from Edinburgh,
contracted to build this fort of Inversnaid; but his
operations were frequently and roughly interrupted.
</p>

<p>
It was commenced during the winter season, and
he and his workmen lodged in huts near the edifice.
</p>

<p>
One night, when the snow was falling heavily in
great and feathery flakes, they were roused by
some travellers noisily demanding shelter.  On the
door being opened, a number of fierce-looking
MacGregors, with their plaids and bonnets coated
with snow, rushed in, menaced the poor workmen
with drawn swords, and reviled them bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Being defenceless and unarmed men, they were
not slain by Rob Roy's followers, but they were
driven half naked through the snow to a distance,
when Greumoch and young Coll dismissed them,
after exacting from them a solemn oath that they
would never again enter the MacGregors' country.
</p>

<p>
Whether the same masons returned or not we
have no means of knowing; but the fort was
ultimately finished and garrisoned.  "Mr. Naysmith,"
says Robert Chambers, "being held by Government
to a contract which he could not fulfil, was seriously
injured in his means by this affair; but its worst
consequence was the effect of exposure on that
dreadful winter night on his health.  He sunk
under his complaints, and died about eighteen
months after."
</p>

<p>
When the fort was complete, the works were
mounted with cannon, and the barrack within it
was occupied by three companies of Lord Tyrawley's
regiment, the South British Fusiliers, under Major
(formerly Captain) Huske, with express orders to
keep the MacGregors in check and to make short
work with them on every occasion&mdash;orders not to
be misconstrued.
</p>

<p>
During the progress of this&mdash;to Rob Roy&mdash;most
obnoxious erection, he lurked with MacAleister in
the cavern near Loch Lomond; the same place
which, as we have said, sheltered the gallant King
Robert I., after the battle of Dalree, where the
famous Brooch of Lorn was torn from his shoulder.
It is near Craigrostan and Inversnaid, on the
eastern bank of the loch.
</p>

<p>
The entrance is near the edge of the water, and
is partly concealed by great masses of rock, like a
fallen Cyclopean wall, which have been shaken by
the volcanic throes of nature from the crags above.
Amid these masses, the wild foxglove, the purple
heather, the green whin, and dense brushwood of
every kind flourish, serving to conceal the access,
which is every way one of peril and difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Here he was perfectly secure, though he could hear
drums beating in Inversnaid; and sometimes he
ventured at night to leave it, and visit his wife and
children, who resided under Greumoch's care, in an
obscure hut among the mountains of Breadalbane;
and on these occasions he twice narrowly escaped
being taken when returning to his retreat.
</p>

<p>
Once, when travelling with three followers, in a
solitary and sequestered place near Loch Earn, a
beautiful sheet of water, from the shore of which the
mountains start in bold and rocky grandeur, he
suddenly found himself face to face with seven
horsemen, in red uniforms, with conical grenadier
caps, on the blue flaps of which the "white horse"
of Hanover was embroidered.  In fact, they were
seven horse grenadiers of Captain MacDougal's
troop, which was then attached to the garrison of
Inversnaid.
</p>

<p>
The tattered yet warlike aspect of MacGregor,
the well-known red and black checks of his tartan,
his powerful figure and ruddy-coloured beard, made
them certain that he was Rob Roy, the outlaw, and
with shouts of "MacGregor!&mdash;MacGregor Campbell!"
some drew their swords, while others took
pistols from their holsters and prepared for an attack.
</p>

<p>
Rob turned to seek safety in flight; but the
soldiers fired, and his three companions fell mortally
wounded.  Infuriated by this, he sprang up the
steep rocks, where their horses could not find
footing, and taking the pistols from his belt, fired
repeatedly, with calm and stern determination,
sending shot after shot at his baffled pursuers, who
remained on the narrow roadway by the loch side,
trampling his dying clansmen under their horses'
hoofs, and brandishing their swords while they
menaced and reviled him.
</p>

<p>
So good was his aim that he killed three of the
soldiers and wounded four of their horses.  On
this, the remainder galloped off, and left him to
pursue, after nightfall, the secret way to his wild
abode.
</p>

<p>
He reached it in safety, but by some means the
horse grenadiers, patrols of whom were constantly
abroad, succeeded in tracking him to its vicinity;
thus, a day or two after the last affair, when he and
MacAleister were issuing forth about dawn, in
search of such food as the mountains afforded, they
suddenly found themselves beset by a party,
commanded by Captain MacDougal in person.
</p>

<p>
With a loud hurrah, the troopers, who were
about thirty in number, put spur to their horses,
and dashed in single file along the narrow
footway on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond; but
one, who outrode all the rest, speedily came up
with Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
"The thousand guineas are mine!" he shouted,
and raising himself in his stirrups, he dealt so furious
a blow with his long and ponderous cavalry sword at
MacGregor, that he beat down his guard, and would
inevitably have cleft him to the teeth by the next
stroke, but for a circular iron plate which he wore
within his bonnet.  The blow, however, brought
him to the ground, and as he fell he exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To your gun, MacAleister!&mdash;to your gun, if
there is a shot in it!"
</p>

<p>
"A witch, and not your grandmother, wrought
your nightcap!" cried the astonished trooper, when
finding that his sword rung on MacGregor's head;
and he had his hilt drawn back to deal the fallen
man a deadly forward home thrust, when a ball
from the long Spanish musket of the faithful
henchman pierced his heart.  He fell from his saddle
lifeless and bleeding, and was dragged by his terrified
horse (for one foot hung in a stirrup) down the
steep bank towards the water, where steed and
corpse disappeared together.
</p>

<p>
MacAleister now assisted his foster-brother to
rise, and escaping MacDougal and the rest of his
troopers, they made a long detour, and reached
their gloomy cavern unseen and in safety.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><br>
THE SNARE.
</h3>

<p>
A noble named the Duke of Athole, who was in
close correspondence with the Government at
Edinburgh, now conceived the hope of entrapping
Rob Roy, and announced to the Secretary of State
and other officials, that he had a sure plan for making
him a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
As this peer was one of the leading Jacobites of
the time, and as all his sons were involved in the
various armed Risings for the House of Stuart, it is
extremely difficult to conceive why he should have
leagued himself with the oppressors of the hapless
MacGregor, unless he had been influenced by the
Duke of Montrose, or was inspired by the strange
animosity which so many cherished against the
Clan Alpine.
</p>

<p>
The duke contrived to send to Rob Roy a letter,
by a messenger, who found him either in or near
his miserable hiding-place.  This missive contained
a pressing invitation to see him immediately at
the castle of Blair, and offered horses for his
conveyance there.
</p>

<p>
It was now the summer of 1717.
</p>

<p>
Although Rob Roy had every reason to believe
that Athole, from the similarity of their political
views had no personal animosity to him, he would
not fail to remember, that he had at one time leagued
himself with the Whig faction, and had taken
from the English ministry the sum of a thousand
pounds for his signature to the treaty of Union, ten
years ago, though he had <i>publicly</i> opposed it in all
its stages in Parliament.
</p>

<p>
So MacGregor was too wary to trust himself in
such slippery hands without some firm assurance of
safety.  He, therefore, wrote to the duke, delicately
hinting the want of confidence he now felt in
most men; the desperation of his circumstances,
the condition of his homeless wife and children, and
wishing to have his grace's commands in writing.
</p>

<p>
In reply, the wily duke "gave him the most
solemn promises of protection, adding, that he only
wished to have some private conversation with him
on certain political points.  This was followed by an
emissary, who gave even more positive assurances
that no evil was intended, and then handed him a
<i>protection from Government</i>.  On seeing this our
hero consented, and fixed a time for being at the
duke's residence."
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by MacAleister, he duly appeared
on a day in July at the castle of Blair, in a chamber
of which the duke had treacherously concealed an
officer and sixty soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The castle is a baronial edifice of great extent
and unknown antiquity; one portion of it is still
named the Comyns Tower, from John of Strathbolgie,
who built it, and it has stood many a siege
in the stormy times of old.  A forest of splendid
trees and a vast expanse of beautiful scenery are
around it.
</p>

<p>
The wandering life led by MacGregor had now
imparted somewhat of wildness to the aspect and
costume of his henchman and himself.
</p>

<p>
His eyes were sunken and had become keen and
fierce, as those of one who in every sound, even to
the rustle of a dry leaf, heard the tread of an enemy.
Long untrimmed and unshorn, his hair and curly
beard waved in masses about his weatherbeaten
face.  His red tartans, every thread of which had
been spun by Helen's hands, her labour of love, were
worn and frittered.  His coat was made of coarse
homespun black and white wool in its natural state,
just as it came from the sheep's back, with two
rows of large wooden buttons; and he wore a red
woollen shirt, for the Highlanders still disdained
linen and cotton as effeminate.
</p>

<p>
He had an eagle's feather and a sprig of pine in
his bonnet; his target, battered and dinted by many
a blade and bullet, was slung on his left shoulder,
and he had as usual his sword, dirk, and pistols,
when, all unconscious of the wicked snare that was
laid for him, he and his follower presented
themselves at the splendid residence of the Duke of
Athole.
</p>

<p>
The latter, who had been made aware of his
approach, received him, apparently, with great
cordiality.
</p>

<p>
"I know not how to express the joy I feel in
having so brave a gentleman in my house," said he,
"but, as a first favour, I must beg of you to lay
aside your sword and pistols."
</p>

<p>
"Wherefore, my lord?" asked Rob, who felt
surprised at a request so unusual.
</p>

<p>
"The duchess is somewhat timid, and the sight
of such things always alarms her."
</p>

<p>
"By my faith, Athole, had she seen her rooftree
in flames, and as much of her own blood shed as
the goodwife of Inversnaid has seen in her time,
the sight of an armed man would not cause
uneasiness," replied Rob, with a sigh of anger, as he
unbuckled his sword-belt, took the dirk and pistols
from his girdle, and said, "but where is your good
lady, duke?"
</p>

<p>
"In the garden, where we shall join her."
</p>

<p>
"MacAleister, keep my claymore and tacks for
me, and await me here," said Rob, handing the
weapons to his henchman, through whose mind
some vague suspicions floated, as he never once
removed his keen glance from the face of the
duke, on whom he gazed as if he would have
read his soul.  But now Rob and his host
descended by a flight of steps into the garden of the
castle.
</p>

<p>
The duchess, Katherine, who was a daughter of
the Duke of Hamilton, came hurriedly forward to
meet the famous outlaw, of whom she had heard so
much, and to whom she frankly presented her hand
to kiss,&mdash;for she was as yet ignorant of the vile
plot her husband had framed.
</p>

<p>
She then presented to him her son, the little
Lord Tullybardine, who eight-and-twenty years
after was to unfurl the banner of Prince Charles
Edward in Glenfinnan; and poor Rob, when he
saw the rich dress of the fair-haired boy, thought
with a sigh of his own sons, who were at times
compelled to share the abode of the fox and the
eagle.
</p>

<p>
"MacGregor," exclaimed the duchess, on seeing
him without a sword; "MacGregor here, and
<i>unarmed</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Rob discovered in a moment that he was the
victim of some perfidy, for by this simple exclamation
the duchess proved that her husband had been
guilty of falsehood.  He bestowed a glance of stern
inquiry on the duke, who coloured deeply, and said
with an air of manifest confusion&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I thought your sword might prove troublesome
if anything unpleasant occurred between us."
</p>

<p>
"Between friends&mdash;between a guest and a
host&mdash;what could occur that would be unpleasant?"
replied MacGregor; "Athole, I understand you
not."
</p>

<p>
"You will understand this, <i>Mr.</i> MacGregor,"
said the duke, suddenly throwing aside all disguise,
"that you have committed such wild work along
the Highland border since the battle of Sheriffmuir,
ay, since you harried the lands of Kippen, after
the battle of Killycrankie, that I must detain you."
</p>

<p>
"Detain?" repeated Rob, with surprise and
contempt.
</p>

<p>
"And send you to Edinburgh."
</p>

<p>
"Where I should swing on a gibbet, a holiday
sight for the psalm-singing burgesses, even as
Alaster of Glenstrae was swung after the field of
Glenfruin!  Am I then snared&mdash;betrayed?" exclaimed
Rob, starting back, and looking round for
the means of defence or escape; but the high walls
of the garden were on three sides, and the towers
of the castle closed in the fourth, and therein
was his faithful henchman, whom he could not
desert in peril, even could he have made an
escape from the garden.  "Dare you tell me,
Duke of Athole," he resumed, "that you have
betrayed me?"
</p>

<p>
"Phrase it as you please, I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Has a man of your rank and name a soul so
mean, so vile, that he will forfeit honour and faith
to win the paltry reward offered for the head of a
loyal and unfortunate gentleman, whom tyranny
and oppression have covered with ruin, and driven
to despair and shame?"
</p>

<p>
Deadly pale and terrified by this unexpected
scene, the gentle duchess shrunk close to her
husband, who when MacGregor made a forward stride,
laid his hand on his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said he, "do you threaten me, in my own
castle of Blair?";
</p>

<p>
"Villain!" exclaimed MacGregor, "you shall
live to repent the deed of to-day."
</p>

<p>
Clenching his right hand, he would have struck
the duke to the earth, but for a piteous shriek
which burst from his lady.  At that moment the
iron gate of the Comyns Tower was thrown furiously
open, and an officer rushed forth, sword in hand,
followed by sixty soldiers, who instantly surrounded
MacGregor, and beat him down with the butt-ends
of their muskets.
</p>

<p>
"Had you surrendered in proper time, Mr. MacGregor
<i>Campbell</i>," said the duke, with ungenerous
irony, "we had not been compelled to resort to
these rough measures in capturing you."
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy laughed scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"You would have asked me to surrender, my
lord duke; but for a MacGregor to surrender is to
die with ignominy; to resist to the end is to die
with honour to ourselves and our forefathers.  A
hundred and twenty years of oppression have made
us what we are now; but a time may come when
even the cunning Lowlander shall weep for the
snare of to-day, and shall tremble at the vengeance
of Clan Alpine!"
</p>

<p>
"Zounds! but you are a bold fellow to be a
gentleman-drover&mdash;a seller of black cattle," said
the duke, mockingly.
</p>

<p>
"Do not condescend to sneer at an unfortunate
man, my lord; it was honester to sell Scottish cattle
than our good old Scottish kingdom.  I have sold
many a thousand head of stots and stirks to the
English; but I would rather have died&mdash;yea, upon
a common gibbet&mdash;than have sold the free land of
my forefathers, as Esau sold his birthright for a
mess of pottage&mdash;even as you and others sold
yours on that black Beltane day, in 1707!"
</p>

<p>
"Tie this fellow with cords, and away with
him," said the duke, rendered furious by this
taunt.
</p>

<p>
He was then secured with ropes, and dragged
from the castle to the adjacent village, where he
was thrust into a cottage and kept under a strong
escort till his captor made further arrangements.
</p>

<p>
Bound and manacled like the fugitive bankrupt,
the rebel and outlaw they had made him, and which
they so ungenerously assumed him to be, MacGregor
for a time felt all the bitterness and despair
that could sting a spirit so generous, so proud and
untameable, when reflecting on the perfidious stroke
of fortune which thus placed him so completely at
the mercy of his tormentors.
</p>

<p>
He thought of the joy and triumph of Montrose
and Killearn, of Carden, Luss, Aberuchail, and
others, whom his sword had so long kept at bay;
he thought of the grief of his homeless wife and
children, whom that sword had been so often drawn
to feed and to defend.  He thought of the shameful
and ignominious death which awaited him as surely
as the breath of Heaven was in his nostrils; he
thought of his landless, nameless, broken and
degraded clan, left without a head to direct, or a
leader to avenge them, and he well-nigh wept in
his agony of soul!
</p>

<p>
MacAleister, on beholding him dragged across
the lawn, surrounded by a company of soldiers,
uttered a shout of grief and rage, as he sprang from
one of the windows of the castle.
</p>

<p>
Some there were who rashly made an effort to
stop him, but with his sword in one hand and his
dirk in the other he dashed them aside like children,
and escaping a few shots that were fired after him,
fled with the speed of a roebuck towards the river
Tilt, into which he plunged and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Some averred that he was drowned, as the stream
was swollen by a summer flood; but it was otherwise,
for he reached in safety the hut where Helen
MacGregor resided, and related what had happened,
</p>

<p>
"A Dhia!" she exclaimed, as she threw up her
hands in despair; "not Fingal's self could save him
now!"
</p>

<p>
"The Red MacGregor is not out of the land
of the heather yet," said MacAleister, hopefully, as
he prepared to return to watch over, and, if possible,
to succour him.
</p>

<p>
But Helen experienced all the bitterness of a
sorrow that was <i>without hope</i>.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br><br>
WILL HE ESCAPE?
</h3>

<p>
The Duke of Athole immediately wrote to
Lieutenant-General Carpenter, who had succeeded John,
Duke of Argyle and Greenwich, as Commander-in-Chief
in Scotland (the general was also Governor of
Minorca), informing him that he had "captured
Robert MacGregor Campbell, the famous outlaw
and rebel, for whose apprehension a large sum had
been so long offered by the authorities."
</p>

<p>
He requested the general to send from Edinburgh
a body of troops to escort the prisoner to that city,
and, in compliance with his wish, a troop of Lord
Polwarth's Scottish Light Horse (now the 7th
Hussars), marched so far as Kinross.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the unfortunate MacGregor was kept
a close prisoner, manacled with cords, and guarded
day and night by the vassals of the duke, and
a party of Captain MacDougal's Horse Grenadiers,
whom he had obtained from the officer commanding
in Perth.
</p>

<p>
In a short time it was known all over Scotland
that Rob Roy was a captive; but the mode of his
capture, and the foul treachery which characterized
it, covered Athole with disgrace, though he seems
to have felt no small vanity at the success of his
snare, if we may judge from a letter which he wrote
to John, Duke of Roxburgh, who was Secretary of
State for North Britain, minutely detailing the
affair.
</p>

<p>
Panting for freedom and for vengeance, both of
which were justly his, Rob Roy was kept under the
military escort at a place called Logierait, which
lies eight miles north of Dunkeld; there he had
been conveyed after his capture in the castle of
Blair.
</p>

<p>
It was a dark and boisterous night when the
troops began their march from the latter place,
with the prisoner still bound and tied to a horse; a
horse grenadier with his unslung carbine riding on
each side of him.  The clouds were driven in black
masses along the summits of Ben-ghlo and
Cairn-na-Gabar (or the mountain of the goats), and the
roaring wind rolled over the thick old forests of
Blair Athole, bowing the trees till their masses
seemed to heave like the waves of the sea, in the
fitful gleams of the moon.  On halting at Logierait,
the duke ordered MacGregor to be kept there
securely, until a properly-mounted escort of his
own people was in readiness to convey him to
Edinburgh.  The duke was resolved that the whole
merit of the capture should remain with himself,
and that even the king's troops should not share it.
</p>

<p>
But this vanity proved in the end his own defeat.
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy, on finding himself in one of the
miserable cottages of the village, began to hope
that he might perhaps achieve an escape.  As a
preliminary, he begged the sergeant who commanded
the troopers, to undo the cords which bound his
hands, that he might write a farewell letter to his
unhappy wife, who had then found shelter in the little
farmhouse of Portnellan, at the head of Loch Katrine.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant was a humane man; he said something
about his own wife and little ones who were
far away in old Ireland, and he did as Rob requested,
though in defiance of express orders.
</p>

<p>
Then, as he had been liberal in supplying the
soldiers with whisky and ale, they became friendly
with MacGregor, and so, after a time, the letter was
written; but there was a difficulty in procuring a
messenger to Loch Katrine, as several MacGregors
had located themselves thereabout, and reprisals
were dreaded.
</p>

<p>
The stormy night wore on, and ere long all the
soldiers were sleeping, save one, who stood with
his loaded carbine at the door of the cottage.
</p>

<p>
To MacGregor it seemed as if this man pitied
him, as he had been more gentle than his comrades,
and had ministered to his comfort, so far as he
dared, since the time of his betrayal at Blair.
</p>

<p>
Being strong, active, and wiry as a mountain
stag, to rush on this trooper and wrench away his
carbine would have been an easy task to MacGregor,
but the key of the cottage door hung at
the waist-belt of the sleeping sergeant; thus the
preliminary scuffle would only serve to rouse the
whole party, and ensure his being shot down by
some of them.
</p>

<p>
As these ideas occurred to the captive, he
surveyed the sentinel, whose gaze was never turned
from him.  With a swarthy, almost olive-tinted
face, and deep, dark eyes, he was a stout and
handsome young man; and his profusely-braided
uniform, with its heavy red cuffs, his Horse Grenadier
cap, and tasselled boots, became him well.  He
had his right hand on the lock of his carbine,
the barrel of which rested in the hollow of his
left arm.
</p>

<p>
"How goes the night?" asked MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve has just struck on the kirk clock without,"
replied the soldier; "and the night is wild and
eerie yet.  You can hear the sough of the wind
among the trees, and the roar of the Tay, too."
</p>

<p>
"You are, I think, a south-country man, by your
accent," said MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the trooper, drily, as he was loth
to become too familiar with a prisoner of a character
so formidable, and, moreover, the sergeant might be
awake.
</p>

<p>
"Take another taste of the whisky, man: there
is a drop in the quaich yet.  What part of the south
are you from?"
</p>

<p>
The trooper drained the little wooden cup, and
replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I come from Moffatdale; my auld mother bydes
in a bit thatched housie at Cragieburnwood.  Weary
fall the day I ever left it to become a soldier!"
</p>

<p>
"Moffatdale," said Rob, ponderingly; "many a
good drove of short-legged Argyleshires I have had
driven through it to the southern markets at
Carlisle and Penrith.  I know well the place, the
Hartfell&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And Queensbury Hill, Loch Skene, and the
Greymare's Tail, and Yarrow wi' a' its dowie
dens!" added the soldier, with kindling eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Once when there I fought some militiamen, and
gave them good cause to remember Rob Roy;
though perhaps the loons knew not my name."
</p>

<p>
"When was this?" asked the soldier, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"A year or so after the Union.  It was in a
summer gloaming, when I was riding northward
near Moffat village, I heard the cries of a woman in
anguish.  They came from a deep, dark hollow called
the Gartpool Linn&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Weel ken I the place," said the soldier.
</p>

<p>
"A true Highlander has ever his sword at the
service of a friend, or the defenceless.  I rode into
the dark dingle, and found some rascally militiamen,
with a queen's officer, about to hang some unfortunate
gipsies; but, by my faith!  I gave them their
kail through the reek.  I threw one half of them
into the water, drove off the rest, and passed two
feet of my claymore through the body of the officer,
who must have been a tough fellow, for he seemed
never a bit the worse when I saw him last at the
field of Sheriffmuir.  I cut down the poor gipsies,
who hung on the lower branch of a tree, but they
were dead&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All?"
</p>

<p>
"All, except one&mdash;a boy about the age of Coll&mdash;my
own boy Coll, whom I may never see again; in
this world, at least," added MacGregor, with a
burst of emotion.
</p>

<p>
The soldier, who had listened to this anecdote
with deep interest, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You did more, MacGregor; you gave some
money to the poor harmless lassie that lay at the
foot of the tree&mdash;money to comfort her ere you
went away."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, perhaps I did; but how know you that?"
</p>

<p>
"She was my sister, and I am the half-hanged
gipsy lad whom you saved, MacGregor."
</p>

<p>
"You!" exclaimed the other, with astonishment
in his tone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the soldier, giving his hand to the
outlaw; "I enlisted in Polwarth's Light Horse
after that, and have smelt powder at Ramillies, at
Oudenarde, and Malplacquet.  Then I became a
Horse Grenadier.  Oh!  MacGregor, what can I do
to serve and thank you for the brave deed of that
doleful summer evening?"
</p>

<p>
"Get me a messenger," said MacGregor, huskily;
"one who will take this letter to my poor forlorn
wife."
</p>

<p>
"I shall," replied the soldier, in a whisper, as he
glanced uneasily at his sleeping comrades; "and I
shall do more; the best horse in the troop shall be
at your service before the day dawns if another
cannot be had!"
</p>

<p>
"Say you so?" exclaimed MacGregor, whose
heart leaped with joy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, so sure as my name is Willie Gemmil, even
if I should be shot for it at the drumhead."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you,&mdash;I thank you! my wife, my
bairns!" said Rob, in a broken voice.  "You
know, soldier, what I have been&mdash;think of what I
am.  I have much of goodness, of kindness, of
charity, of love in my heart; yet men deem me a
savage, and seek to make me one.  It may be that
in my desperation and fury, when fired by the sense
of unmerited wrong, I have done severe things;
but the memory of the station I have lost, and of
the success I once hoped to achieve, add deeper
bitterness to my fallen fortunes now.  'Tis well
that old Donald of Glengyle is in his grave, and
knows not the fate of his son!"
</p>

<p>
When day broke, Gemmil was relieved from his
post, and exerted himself to procure a messenger,
with a fleet and active horse.
</p>

<p>
On the man coming to the door of the cottage,
having been instructed by the gipsy trooper what
to do, he dismounted at the moment that Rob Roy,
with the sergeant's permission, came forth to give
the letter and some special message to Helen
MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
Rob's emotion was great on recognizing in the
messenger who had volunteered so readily, his
foster-brother MacAleister, who had been hovering
about Logierait in the hope of achieving something;
but beyond a keen, quick glance nothing passed
between them; but that glance contained a volume.
</p>

<p>
The eyes of the whole troop were upon Rob, yet
he sprang past them, leaped into the empty saddle
of the messenger's horse, and urged it at full speed
towards the bank of the Tay.
</p>

<p>
"Boot and saddle!  To horse and after him!"
exclaimed the sergeant, while a scattered volley of
carbine bullets whistled after MacGregor; but long
before the troop horses were bitted and saddled, he
had plunged into the foaming river, crossed it, and
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The vexation and chagrin of the Duke of Athole
were extreme, when about an hour after this
occurrence he arrived with a band of his own retainers,
all well mounted and armed with swords and
musketoons, to escort the prisoner to Edinburgh, and
found no trace of him but the letter he had written
to Helen, and the cords with which he had been so
ignominiously bound.
</p>

<p>
For a time the fortification and garrison of
Inversnaid were a complete check upon the projects of
Rob Roy; but he resolved ere long to capture the
works and expel the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Though of small value in some respects, his lands
had been sufficient, in those frugal days, for the
maintenance of his family and dependants; and, as
his ancestral rocks and hills, he loved them dearly.
"It is felt as a strange and uncouth association (to
quote the "Domestic Annals of Scotland"), that
Steele, of <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i> memory&mdash;kind-hearted,
thoughtless Dicky Steele&mdash;should have
been one of the persons who administered in the
affairs of the cateran of Craigrostan.  In the final
report of the Commissioners (for forfeited estates)
we have the pitiful account of <i>the public ruin of
poor Rob</i>, Inversnaid being described as of the
yearly value of ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£53. 16s. 8ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½d., and the total sum
realized from it, of purchase-money and interest,
ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£958. 18s.  There is much possible reason to believe
that it would have been a much more advantageous,
as well as humane arrangement, for the public to
have allowed these twelve miles of Highland
mountains to remain in the hands of their former
owner."
</p>

<p>
In the close of the year he went with Greumoch,
MacAleister, and a few other followers to the ducal
castle of Inverary, and there affected to submit to
the Government, by delivering some forty or fifty
swords and pistols to his remote kinsman, Colonel
Patrick Campbell, of Finab; from whom he obtained
a signed protection; after this act, which was performed
merely <i>to gain time</i>, he could not be molested
by the troops or civil authorities.
</p>

<p>
But he returned to Breadalbane more than ever
determined to exert every energy in storming the
fortress of Inversnaid, in expelling the garrison,
and resolved to spend the last of his life in punishing
Montrose, Athole, Killearn, and all who had ever
wronged or injured him.
</p>

<p>
We shall soon see the sequel to these bold projects.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br><br>
LITTLE RONALD.
</h3>

<p>
About this time there occurred two circumstances,
which&mdash;more than any outrage that had preceded
them&mdash;impelled Rob to attack the Sassenach
invaders, for so he deemed them at Inversnaid.
</p>

<p>
Near Eas-teivil, or the Fall of the Tummel, in the
face of a tremendous rock, is a cavern to which
there is a narrow path, accessible only to one person
at a time.  Therein several fugitive MacGregors
were surprised by some of Huske's soldiers, who
had been conducted there by a spy named
MacLaren.  One-half were shot down or bayonneted.
The others fought their way out, but fell
over the rock, and clung to the trees which grew
from its face.
</p>

<p>
There they swung in blind desperation above the
foaming stream, "upon which," says the "Statistical
Reporter," "the pursuers cut off their arms,
and precipitated them to the bottom," to be swept
away by the rushing water.
</p>

<p>
These tidings filled Rob Roy with a glow of fury,
which the second event was in no way calculated
to cool.
</p>

<p>
It chanced that on a day in spring, his second
son, Ronald, a boy in his fourteenth year, despite
the intreaties of his mother, and the injunctions of
his father, strolled over the hills with his fishing-rod,
along the banks of Loch Arclet, and actually
fished within sight of Inversnaid.
</p>

<p>
Little Ronald was brave as a lion.  Once he had
climbed the giddiest of the rocks above Loch
Lomond, with his dirk in his teeth, to destroy the
nest of a gigantic iolar or mountain eagle, which
preyed on the lambs of a poor widow who was his
foster-mother.
</p>

<p>
He was generous, too, as he was brave, for the
boy once nearly perished in the deep drift of a
corrie, when searching amid the winter snow for
the lost sheep of a poor herdsman who was sick.
Every way in spirit Ronald was his father's son!
</p>

<p>
On this day in spring, when his fish-basket was
pretty well filled with spotted trout, and the long
mountain-shadows cast by the setting sun began to
remind him of the distance that lay between Loch
Arclet and the secluded little farm of Portnellan, he
was preparing to quit his sport, when three redcoats
suddenly appeared on the narrow footway, so
Ronald turned to fly.
</p>

<p>
That he strove to avoid them in those days need
not excite wonder; for such were the atrocities of
the British and Hessian troops in the Highlands,
and so much was their uniform abhorred for
generations after, that many a Highlander, who in
manhood has led his company or regiment to the
storming of Badajoz and the fields of Vittoria and
Waterloo, when a boy was wont to fly to the woods
for concealment, when by chance he saw a red-coat
on the roads that led to the chain of forts in
the Great Glen of Caledonia.
</p>

<p>
A pistol-shot fired by one of these strangers now
made Ronald pause, as it struck a rock before him,
and turning, with a flushed brow and an agitated
heart, he found himself confronted by Major
Huske and two soldiers, with whom he had
been shooting, scouting, or rambling by the side
of Loch Arclet.
</p>

<p>
Enraged to find himself thus molested, on the
land which Ronald knew to be his father's heritage,
he laid his hand on his dirk and boldly confronted
the major, whose large, square, red-skirted coat,
three-cornered hat, and Ramillies wig, were all
fraught with terrors, which the boy sought to
conceal, for he felt that it would ill become his
father's son to quail beneath a Saxon eye.
</p>

<p>
"Will you sell your fish, my little man?" asked
the major; but Ronald knew as little of English as
the major did of Gaelic so a soldier had to act as
interpreter for them.
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Ronald, sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Then as we want some at the garrison, we shall
be compelled to appropriate what you have," said
Huske, peeping into the basket; "I warrant the
money offered will not be allowed to lie on the
heather."
</p>

<p>
"Take the fish if you want them, and let
me be gone," replied Ronald, throwing his basket
down.
</p>

<p>
"Whither go you?" asked Huske, suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"To my home."
</p>

<p>
"Where is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Among the mountains&mdash;where you would not
be wise to follow," replied the boy, boldly.
</p>

<p>
The soldier perhaps interpreted this with some
awkwardness or severity, for Huske exclaimed
furiously&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Sdeath! you young rascal; do you speak thus
to me?"
</p>

<p>
"And why not, when I am a son of the Red
MacGregor?" was the rash boy's response.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!  I thought as much," exclaimed Huske,
with a malevolent gleam in his eyes; "Come, my
lad, don't let us quarrel about a few fish.  I have
a particular desire to see your worthy father&mdash;he is
a fine fellow, and a good judge of other men's cattle.
We want some of the latter for the garrison.  Can
you tell me where he is?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Ronald, with knitted brows and
clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Where, my boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Where you had better not seek him."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw! will not this bribe you?" said Huske,
slipping three guineas from his purse into Ronald's
hand.
</p>

<p>
Though nurtured amid civil war and sore adversity,
the poor boy knew well the value of the bribe
so infamously offered by Huske, who had never
forgotten nor forgiven his meetings with Rob Roy
in Moffatdale and elsewhere.  Ronald drew himself
proudly up, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You ask me&mdash;you, a soldier&mdash;to betray my father?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay; to discover&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To betray&mdash;Saxon captain, or Saxon dog, mince
the words as you will!"
</p>

<p>
"A mutinous cur; but I'll tame him yet," muttered
the major.
</p>

<p>
"You shall never get my father, alive at least;
for he is strong and brave as Cuchullin!"
</p>

<p>
"Some other Highland savage, I suppose; but,
egad, we shall see."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said the soldier who acted as interpreter,
"would it not be a good plan to let the young cub
loose, and watch him well? in the end he would be
sure to lead us to the old wolf's den."
</p>

<p>
"He would scramble up rocks where none but a
cat or a monkey could follow, or leave us all floundering
to the neck in some treacherous bog.  No, no, I
know better than that.  Offer him three guineas
more."
</p>

<p>
The soldier did so.
</p>

<p>
"You might as well ask me to blow the fire with
my mouth full of meal," was Ronald's contemptuous
reply; "for I would rather die than betray any
man&mdash;to a base Saxon churl least of all!"
</p>

<p>
The soldier clenched his hand, but paused.
</p>

<p>
"Threaten if you will; but strike not!" said
Ronald, with his right hand on his dirk.
</p>

<p>
"You little villain, would you dare to draw on
us?" thundered Major Huske.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, even if you stood at the head of all your
men, and dared to lay a hand on me," replied
Ronald, bursting into tears of passion and fury,
as he flung the guineas full into Huske's face.
</p>

<p>
Filled with rage by this insult, the latter rushed
upon the brave boy and wrenched his dirk away.
Ronald made a desperate resistance, he struggled
kicked, bit, and fought; but he was soon dragged
into the fort by the soldiers, who cast him,
handcuffed, into a dark stone cell.
</p>

<p>
Huske, a brutal officer of the old Dutch or Revolution
school, proposed to tie a cord round the poor
boy's head, and twist it with a pistol-barrel or
drumstick, until agony compelled him to furnish all
the details required about his father's movements;
but the officer next in command, Captain Henry
Clifford, of the South British Fusiliers,* a humane
English gentleman, opposed the cruel idea so
vigorously that Huske abandoned it; so Ronald was
closely watched, and fed on bread and water.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* New.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He was threatened with being flogged at the
halberts, or with being hung on a tree; but nothing
would make him tell aught to his father's enemies.
Yet, though he kept a brave front to "the Saxons,"
as he named them, in the fulness of his heart and
the solitude of his cell, he wept for his parents, and
repeatedly offered up the prayers his mother taught
him, and repeated to himself the twenty-second
Psalm, "Shi Dhia fhein 'm buachalich" (the Lord
is my shepherd).
</p>

<p>
Oina speedily informed the family at Portnellan
of all this.  She had now grown to womanhood,
and was the wife of Alaster Roy.  As a dealer in
eggs, butter, and milk, she frequented the fort,
and there learned the story of the young angler's
capture.
</p>

<p>
This unwarrantable action filled MacGregor with
just indignation, and Helen with lively fears, lest
her golden-haired Ronald might be impressed for a
sailor or soldier, or perhaps sold to the Dutch planters
for a slave; and Rob swore upon the bare blade of
his sword to raze Inversnaid to the ground, and to
give Huske's flesh to the eagles of Ben Lomond ere
the sun of the next Beltane day had risen, while his
mother&mdash;an aged woman now&mdash;vowed that she too
would march to the rescue, though armed only with
her spindle and scissors.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br><br>
PAUL CRUBACH.
</h3>

<p>
Before collecting his followers, or making
preparations to storm Inversnaid, and expel the royal
troops from his patrimony, Rob Roy resolved to
make himself well acquainted with the strength and
resources of the garrison, and with the number of
men and cannon at Major Huske's disposal; and
for this service he availed himself of Oina, who
brought him daily intelligence of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, he had another very efficient spy in
the person of Paul Crubach, whose grotesque
figure and quaint conduct made him a welcome
visitor to the soldiers, who jested and made fun
with him, as a half-witted being; but as usual with
such characters in Scotland, there was a "method
in the madness" of Paul Crubach.
</p>

<p>
One night as he sat by the fireside, in the little
farmhouse of Portnellan, where Ronald's absence
formed a source of perpetual grief, he urged that
before attacking Inversnaid the oracle of the "House
of Invocation" should be consulted; but Rob Roy
though brave as man could be, shrunk from seeking
intercourse with the world of spirits.
</p>

<p>
"Are you afraid?" exclaimed Paul Crubach,
striking his cross-staff fiercely on the floor with
indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Afraid, Paul&mdash;yes, of the devil."
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall face the King of the Cats for you,
and from him I shall extort the knowledge whether
ever again <i>the three glens</i> shall be ours."
</p>

<p>
The eyes of MacGregor sparkled.
</p>

<p>
"The old inheritance of Clan Alpine!" said he;
"yes; Glenlyon, Glendochart, and Glenorchy, shall
again be ours, Paul, but first I must root out and
raze this nest of Saxon hornets at Inversnaid!"
</p>

<p>
"And set free my red-cheeked Ronald," added
Helen, weeping with sorrow and anger, as she
twirled her spindle on the clay floor.
</p>

<p>
"But look before you leap, MacGregor; before
marching learn what the oracle may tell," urged
the old man; "but I shall learn for you, if I have
not, as in past times, a vision before the hour, when,
as the bard of Cona says, 'the hunter awakes from
his noon-day slumber, and hears in his vision the
spirits of the hill.'"
</p>

<p>
Rob shuddered as Paul spoke, for a strange wild
glare flashed in the eyes of this old man, who was
supposed to be a seer, possessing the gift of the
second sight.
</p>

<p>
"If the time serves, Paul," resumed MacGregor,
who wished to change the subject, "I will inscribe
on the rocks of Craigrostan and Inversnaid, in Gaelic
letters, my indisputable right thereto, in defiance of
the elector and his redcoats."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! thou art right," said Paul, grinding his
teeth and brandishing his cross-staff; "do so,
even as MacMillan of South Knapdale, and the
MacMurachies of Terdigan and Kilberrie, had
their charters carved upon the rocks of their
land."
</p>

<p>
"But alas, Paul, that time may never, never
come," said Helen, with a sad smile.
</p>

<p>
"And little would such charters avail me, good
wife, if the good claymore fails," said Rob, with
irony in his eye and tone.
</p>

<p>
"Then," observed Greumoch, who sat in a
corner smoking his pipe and oiling his gun, "we
have the fair sleek skins of the Saxons whereon
to write the story of our wrongs with a pen of
pointed steel."
</p>

<p>
"Enough of this," said Paul Crubach, rising and
drawing a deerskin over his shoulders; "the sooner
my task begins 'twill be the sooner ended."
</p>

<p>
"Whither go you, Paul, and at this hour?"
asked Rob, attempting to detain his strange
guest.
</p>

<p>
"To consult the <i>Tighghairm</i>.  Meet me at sunset
on the second day from this, at the Ladders,
above Loch Katrine, and you will there learn what
the future has in store for us; whether we shall be
the victors at Inversnaid, whether your boy shall
be freed, and whether we shall again possess the
three glens, which are the heritage of Clan Alpine,
or be vanquished and destroyed."
</p>

<p>
And before MacGregor, Helen, or Greumoch
could interpose, Paul had snatched his cross-staff,
and, with his long white hair streaming behind him
in elf-locks, had rushed forth into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
MacGregor, whose intercourse with Englishmen
and Lowlanders had made him somewhat more a
man of the world than his followers, was nevertheless
too strongly imbued with the old superstitions
and native predilections of his race and country not
to await with considerable interest, though mingled
with doubt, the result of those spells which all in
the district believed the half-witted Paul Crubach
was capable of weaving, or the visions with which
he was supposed to be visited.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, about the sunset of the second day,
MacGregor, well armed as usual, repaired alone to
the appointed place of tryst.
</p>

<p>
The Ladders was the name of a dangerous and
difficult track, which then formed the only access to
Loch Katrine from Callendar.
</p>

<p>
He entered the narrow pass, which is half a mile
in length.  There the rocks are stupendous in
height, in some places seeming to impend over the
head of the wayfarer; in others, aged weeping
birches hang their drooping foliage over the basaltic
cliffs from which they spring, adding a wild beauty
to the rugged gorge.
</p>

<p>
Across the summits of this pass, which is a
portion of the famous Trossachs, the dying sunlight
shone in red and uncertain gleams, through stormy
clouds of dusky and saffron tints, for all the
preceding night loud peals of thunder had shaken the
mountains, and even yet the atmosphere was close
and sulphurous.
</p>

<p>
At last Rob reached the Ladders, which consisted
of steps roughly hewn out of the solid rock.  By
means of these, and ropes suspended from the trees,
to be grasped by the hand, the bold and hardy
natives of this part of the Highlands were wont to
traverse the pass, which, in time of war, one
swordsman could defend against a thousand.
</p>

<p>
Rob slung his target on his shoulder, grasped
the ropes, and from step to step swung himself
lightly up the beetling rocks until he reached the
summit, from whence he could see, far down below,
Loch Katrine, a lovely sheet of water ten miles in
length, gleaming redly in the last light of the sun,
whose rays lingered yet on the vast peak of Benvenue,
and on the beautiful hills of Arroquhar, that
closed the view to the west.
</p>

<p>
In the loch is an islet, wherein, during the
invasion of Scotland by Oliver Cromwell, the Clan
Gregor had placed all their aged men, their women
and children, for security.  On finding that the only
boat remaining was moored at the islet, an English
soldier swam across to seize it, but was stabbed to
the heart by Iole MacGregor, the grandmother of
Rob's foster-brother, Callam MacAleister.
</p>

<p>
The scenery was alike wild and grand, and the
great masses of lurid and dun-coloured thunder-clouds
that overhung the darkening hills added to
its effect.
</p>

<p>
With his keen and glittering eyes fixed on the
place where the sun had set, Paul Crubach sat on a
fragment of volcanic rock.  He seemed wan, pale,
and weary; his masses of tangled hair and his
primitive garb of deerskin seemed to have been
scorched by fire, and his bare legs and arms were
covered with scars and bruises.
</p>

<p>
Propping himself on his cross-staff, he arose with
apparent difficulty on the approach of MacGregor,
who said, with anxiety,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"In Heaven's name, what has happened&mdash;what
have you done, Paul?"
</p>

<p>
"I have opened the House of Invocation.  I
have consulted the oracle of the <i>Tighghairm</i>," said
he, solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Did it speak?" asked Rob, with growing wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Listen; I passed the night in the Coir nan
Uriskin."
</p>

<p>
"In the cave of the wild shaggy men!"
exclaimed the other, starting with more of actual
fear than astonishment in his manner.
</p>

<p>
"Yea, even there," replied Paul, closing his eyes
for a moment, and sighing deeply.
</p>

<p>
"What did you see&mdash;what did you hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Listen, and I shall tell you what happened."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap27"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br><br>
THE HOUSE OF INVOCATION.
</h3>

<p>
Paul related that after sunset on the preceding
evening he had sought that remarkable cavern or
den, which lies at the base of Benvenue.
</p>

<p>
It is a deep and circular hollow in the side of the
mountain, about six hundred yards wide at the top,
but narrows steeply towards the bottom, on all
sides surrounded by stupendous masses of shattered
rock, covered so thickly with wild birches that their
interlaced branches almost intercept the sunlight
even at noon.
</p>

<p>
For ages, local superstition has made this place
the abode of the Urisks, wild shaggy men, or
lubber-fiends, who were fashioned like the ancient
satyrs, being half-men and half-goats; thus their
very name was fraught with many indescribable
terrors, and hence the spot was avoided by the most
hardy huntsmen, even at mid-day.
</p>

<p>
There Paul had repaired as the night was closing
in, carrying with him, instead of his cross-staff, the
blade of an ancient sword without a hilt, and a
black cat securely tied in a bag.
</p>

<p>
Selecting the very centre of the coir, or hollow,
he drew a circle three times round him with the
sword-blade, and collecting a quantity of dry
branches, dead leaves, and moss, he added some
pieces of coffin-boards, brought from his remarkable
hut in Strathfillan, and lighted a fire.  Amid the
growing flames he thrust the sword-blade firmly
into the earth, with the point uppermost.
</p>

<p>
Then he drew from the bag the fated cat, the
paws of which were securely tied with a cord.  As
the increasing flames rose fast, he thrust the poor
animal upon the upright sword, impaling it alive,
the supposed necessity of the ordeal rendering Paul
completely callous and heedless of the cruelty he
was perpetrating.
</p>

<p>
Then the shrill cries of the tortured cat woke a
thousand echoes among the rocks of that ghastly
hollow, while it spat and bit at the steel on which
its blood was dripping to hiss on the fire below.
Its jaws were distended, and its protruding eyes
glared like opals in the light; its ears were laid flat,
and every hair was bristling with fear and agony,
till scorched off by the rising flames.
</p>

<p>
Their lurid light cast strange and fantastic
gleams on the rocks of that solemn hollow; and
when in the moaning night wind the birches waved
their drooping branches to and fro, the whole place
seemed to fill with moving figures of quaint and
unearthly aspect.
</p>

<p>
As the yells of the tortured cat woke them up,
sharp-nosed foxes peeped forth from their holes
with glittering eyes, fleet squirrels scampered up
the trees, and the birds screamed and whirred in
flocks out of the hollow; but fast and furiously
there gathered from all quarters cats, wild and
domestic; over the bushes and rocks they came
swarming, as if to the rescue, with open mouths,
protruding eyes, extended claws, and backs erect;
but they were compelled to pause, being unable
to enter the charmed circle, or it might be
perhaps that the glare of the fire terrified or
bewildered them.
</p>

<p>
Cats in countless numbers&mdash;black, white, grey,
and brindled&mdash;covered all the rocks of the Coir
nan Uriskin, according to Paul, denouncing in fury
the torment of their companion, till their spitting
and hissing sounded like the rush of a waterfall;
for though many of these sudden visitors were of
the common size and kind, many more were the
wild cats of the mountains, which are four times
larger than the domestic, with yellow coats, black
streaks, thick flat tails, and are armed with claws
and teeth well calculated to inspire terror.
</p>

<p>
Then as the branches of the trees waved to and
fro, their shadows on the weather-beaten rocks
seemed more distinctly to assume the strange form,
the quaint and savage faces of the terrible Urisks,
that glimmered and jabbered at these unhallowed
proceedings.  But the resolute Paul continued to
mutter,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  See not this!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear not that!<br>
  Round with the spit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turn the cat!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So he never looked about him nor quailed in his
grim work, for he knew that greater terrors would
yet surround him ere the fiend he was summoning
would appear.  For if the <i>Gluasa-leabhra</i> came to
the rescue of his tortured subject&mdash;this terrible
king of the cats, distinguished from all others of
the mountain by his tiger-like proportions and
wondrous strength&mdash;Paul knew that <i>then</i> would be
the critical moment of his fate; for if his heart
failed him on hearing the yell of this half-cat,
half-demon, he must be overborne by the whole living
mass, which now covered the sides of the Coir nan
Uriskin; his body would be rent into a thousand
pieces, and the <i>future</i> of Clan Alpine would never
be learned!
</p>

<p>
The midnight air was growing dense and
sulphurous; gleams of lightning began to play
about the bleak summit of Benvenue, and the
deep thunder grumbled in the distance.  Drops
of hot rain were falling heavily too; but Paul
felt them not, for his heart leaped within him as
he shouted,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Wretch, come forth!  He is coming!&mdash;he is coming!"
</p>

<p>
The poor cat impaled upon the sword-blade was
expiring now; half-roasted alive, its eyeballs yet
protruded from their sockets; surcharged with
blood, they had become red as rubies, and its
mouth opened and shut spasmodically.
</p>

<p>
White as milk or thistle-down, Paul's long and
tangled hair glittered in the wavering fire-light
and in the livid gleams that shot athwart the sky;
but still he tossed his skeleton arms aloft, and
whirled the dying cat upon the sword-blade with
a piece of burning brand.
</p>

<p>
In their sunken sockets Paul's eyeballs blazed
like burning coals, for every moment he expected
to see the trembling earth open, and the
unchained fiend appear before him; but the rocks
of the Coir nan Uriskin trembled by no
demoniac spell, but with the boom of the pealing
thunder alone.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a splitting roar and a dreadful
crash; a blinding sheet of livid flame filled
the whole hollow; for a moment the wet rocks
seemed to sparkle like masses of crystal, and the
trees were seen to toss and twist wildly upward
their rending branches in the blast.  Then all
became darkness and all silence, save when the
thunder of the midnight storm grumbled in the
distance far away.
</p>

<p>
A thunderbolt had struck the rocks of the
hollow; Paul became senseless, and remembered no
more till morning dawned, when he found himself
lying near a thunder-riven rock in the Coir nan
Uriskin amid the ashes of his extinguished fire,
and close by him the charred remains of his
victim still impaled by the sword-blade.
</p>

<p>
The adventures of the night&mdash;how much of these
were true and how much were <i>fancy</i> the reader
may easily determine&mdash;had sorely exhausted the
strength of this strange old man, to whose
narrative Rob Roy listened with astonishment, not
unmingled with alarm, for the scene of his spells
was fraught with innumerable terrors.
</p>

<p>
"Thus, MacGregor, I have sinned and perilled
my soul for nothing," groaned Paul, closing his
eyes, as if in exhaustion; "I have invoked in vain,
and in vain has the terrible ordeal of the
Tighghairm been undergone!"
</p>

<p>
"If all this be true, Paul, you were near rousing
the devil to little purpose.  For had he told you
that we would be victorious, we would fight; if
defeated and dispersed, <i>still</i> would we fight, till
the last of us was gathered to his fathers.  So for
true tidings of the enemy I would rather trust to
the lass Oina than to your devilish cantrips."
</p>

<p>
"You would trust in a woman?" said Paul,
disdainfully.
</p>

<p>
"She can reckon every redcoat in Inversnaid
as well as you or I could do, Paul."
</p>

<p>
"What said St. Colme of Iona?  'Where there
is a cow there will be a woman, and where there is
a woman there will be <i>mischief</i>; so neither one
nor the other ever set foot on the Isle of the
Waves in <i>his</i> time.'"
</p>

<p>
"An ungallant speech," said Rob, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"But a true one.  Pause and consider well, for
a son of Fortune waits and attains his end in
peace; but the luckless hastens on unadvisedly,
and evil befalls him."
</p>

<p>
"Dioul!" said the other, with knitted brow;
"I am no son of Fortune, but an outlawed son of
Alpine!  I thank you for your advice, Paul; but
return to Portnellan, and get food to restore your
wasted strength.  I will trust to the kind God
above us," he added, uncovering his head, and
looking upward, "to Him and to my father's
sword, rather than to a voice from hell!  To-night
I cross the hills to Inversnaid, where my poor boy
Ronald and my patrimony are alike kept from me
by these Saxon intruders.  Coll, Greumoch,
MacAleister, and the rest are to follow me with five
hundred men.  We shall gather at the burn foot,
where it flows into Loch Lomond, on the third
night from this.  Sharp war brings sure peace;
and ere the sun of the next day shines upon the
mountains, I shall cock my bonnet on the ruins
of Inversnaid, or lie low on the heather as death
can lay me!"
</p>

<p>
With these words Rob and Paul Crubach parted.
</p>

<p>
The latter turned away with tottering steps to
seek the farmhouse of Portnellan, where Helen
MacGregor, with her boys, Hamish and Duncan,
were to wait the issue of the attack upon the king's
fort and barrack; while Rob threw his target on
his shoulder, and lithely and agilely descended the
precipitous ladder in the rocks, and alone, as night
was closing, sought the road to Callendar.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br><br>
ROB ROY'S CAVE.
</h3>

<p>
The Red MacGregor knew well that the destruction
of Inversnaid and the dispersion of its garrison
would render him popular even with his enemies;
for that fort had been built to overawe the
Buchanans, the Colquhouns of Luss, and the
Stewarts of Ardvoirlich, as well as the MacGregors;
yet none but the latter had the daring to attempt
its capture.
</p>

<p>
It was always garrisoned by a strong party from
the castle of Dumbarton, relieved at regular
intervals.
</p>

<p>
Full of thought and of the bold deed he had in
contemplation, MacGregor travelled alone by the
northern base of Benvenue, from whence, across
the waters of Loch Katrine, he could see the lights
glittering in the windows of the thatched farmhouse,
where his family resided, at Portnellan, near
where the western end of that lovely sheet of water
flows into Glengyle, and with a prayer on his lips
for their protection, and a sigh of hope for the
future, he drew tighter his girdle, secured his belted
plaid upon his breast by his brooch, and crossed the
rugged mountain slope with long strides unerringly
in the dark, for the night was moonless, and after a
journey of ten or twelve miles, he reached his old
lurking-place, the cavern, on the banks of Loch
Lomond.
</p>

<p>
From this place he could overlook the lands that
were once his own, and where whilom he had been
able to count the grey smoke of a hundred cottages
rising in the clear air of an autumn evening, and
knew that in these humble abodes all loved him with
a love that went beyond the grave; but the times
were changed, and with a sigh of bitterness he
entered the cavern.
</p>

<p>
He looked carefully to the flints and priming of
his pistols, and casting himself on a bed of dry
soft heather, prepared for him in a hollow of the
rocks by the careful hands of Oina, he placed his
drawn sword beside him, and addressed himself to
sleep, as he expected a visit from her in the morning
when she could leave the fort, where she had been
latterly engaged as the servant of an officer's wife.
</p>

<p>
Hour after hour passed, and MacGregor heard no
sound but the night wind as it swept the bleak
mountain side, and tossed the wild whins and
brakens that fringed the mouth of his dark hiding-place.
</p>

<p>
Sleep was stealing gradually over him when some
strange dark objects appeared at the cavern mouth.
Starting, he snatched up his sword and pistols; but
paused, for the figures had short horns, floating
beards, and red glaring eyes that peered in at him
from behind the ledges of rock.
</p>

<p>
On the first alarm he thought that soldiers had
tracked him hither; then the diablerie of Paul's
recent proceedings, and his strange narrative of the
night he had passed in the den of the Urisks,
flashed upon Rob's memory, and made his flesh
creep; for now, head after head, with horns and
beard and red glancing eyes, came along the lower
edge of the cavern floor, appearing darkly and
indistinctly against the dim light without.
</p>

<p>
MacGregor levelled a pistol and fired; then there
was a rush of many feet down the slope, and on
springing to the cavern mouth, he found that he
had been scared by a herd of poor mountain goats,
which he saw now leaping from rock to rock in
terror and dismay.
</p>

<p>
Then Rob laughed aloud at the excitement or
overstrained fancy which had caused such unusual
emotions of alarm; and he thought of the good King
Robert I., who had been similarly startled in the same
place.  For we are told, that after his defeat by the
rebellious Western Highlanders at Dalree in Strathfillan,
he fled down the glen, crossed the Falloch, and
alone and unattended reached Loch Lomond side,
and at Inversnaid took shelter in this same cavern.
There he slept in his armour on the bare rocks, with
his sword drawn by his side&mdash;the sword that was
never to be sheathed till Scotland were freed alike
from Western rebels and English invaders.
</p>

<p>
In the mirk midnight, the war-worn king awoke,
and was at first astonished, and then amused, to
find the cave full of wild mountain goats, whose
lair it was; and tradition adds, that Bruce found
himself so comfortable among them, that when
peace was proclaimed and the Parliament met, he
passed "a law whereby all goats should be grass
mail (or rent) free."
</p>

<p>
In that cave King Robert passed the night, and
in the morning there came to him Sir Maurice of
Buchanan, who conducted him to Malcolm Earl of
Lennox.
</p>

<p>
On the same rock where, perhaps, the Bruce's
head was pillowed, Rob Roy dropped into a
profound sleep, and the morning sun was shining
brightly on the woods of silver birch and sombre
pine, and on the green isles of Loch Lomond, when
he awoke to find Oina seated near him, with a little
basket by her side, and a red plaid drawn over her
head, patiently watching him, and waiting the
moment when he would be stirring.  In one hand
she had a hunting-bottle of usquebaugh, and in the
other a little quaich formed of juniper and birch
staves alternately, smoothly polished, and hooped
with silver.
</p>

<p>
The little girl, with the thick brown tresses
described in the first chapter of our story, was now a
tall matron, with her dark hair gathered under a
curchie.  Her brow was thoughtful and severe, for
many a time since the day on which her boy
companion, Colin Bane, had been slain by Duncan nan
Creagh, had she looked death in the face amid
flashing swords and flaming rafters; and she was
now, as stated, the wife of Alaster Roy MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
"You have come at last, Oina," said Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
"Say not that as a taunt," said she, "for I could
not leave the fort of Inversnaid before the gates
were opened at daybreak."
</p>

<p>
"I did not say it tauntingly, Oina," replied Rob,
patting her shoulder; "but what of my poor boy
Ronald?"
</p>

<p>
"He is still in a cell, where I cannot have speech
with him."
</p>

<p>
"A cell!  How his free Highland soul must
abhor such confinement!  Patience yet awhile, my
boy, for the blades are on the grindstone that ere
long shall free you.  But do they keep surer watch
than usual at Inversnaid?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say; but more of the red soldiers
arrived yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"More?" repeated Rob, starting.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"How many?"
</p>

<p>
"Forty at least; they came by a boat up Loch
Lomond from Dumbarton."
</p>

<p>
"How many are in the fort now?"
</p>

<p>
"I have reckoned four companies of eighty men
each."
</p>

<p>
"Three hundred and twenty muskets."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, for twenty of these have halberts."
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;the sergeants."
</p>

<p>
"Then there are six <i>tairneanach</i>" (thunder-mouths).
</p>

<p>
"At the gate.  I have marked them from the
hill; they are six-pound cannon, I believe; but let us
once pass the barrier and they will be useless.  I
have but five hundred claymores, yet I will make
an attempt, if it should cost me my life and the lives
of all who adhere to me," said Rob Roy, firmly.
</p>

<p>
"At what hour will you advance?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow night at twelve."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  I shall endeavour to dispose of the
sentinel at the gate."
</p>

<p>
"With the dirk?  Nay, I like not that, Oina,"
said Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, with <i>this</i>," she replied, laughing, as she
took the hunting-bottle of whisky from the basket in
which she had brought a breakfast for MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow night we muster at the burn foot,
near Inversnaid.  At twelve the attack will
commence&mdash;twelve remember, Oina; and if the sentinel
be not silenced by you, we must e'en trust to the
sledge-hammer first and the steel blade after."
</p>

<p>
When Oina left him to return to the fort the
hours passed slowly and anxiously with MacGregor,
who in his hiding-place could hear the drums when
they were beaten at daybreak, sunset, and tattoo,
in the barrack at Inversnaid; and he prayed that
the time might come when that sound, which was
rendered, by association, so hateful to a Highland
ear, would be hushed among his native hills for ever.
</p>

<p>
Whether victorious or not, Rob Roy could
scarcely hope that an act so daring as an attack on
a royal garrison would pass unpunished; but he
heeded not.  By that deed he resolved to make a
terrible protest against the usurpation of his land,
and the erection of such a building in the country
of the MacGregors.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX.
<br><br>
THE STORMING OF INVERSNAID.
</h3>

<p>
The eventful night proved dark and cloudy.  The
month was April, but already the young buds had
burst, and were in full leaf in the wild woods that
bordered Loch Lomond, when Rob clambered out
of the deep rocky fissure which formed the approach
to his cavern, and sought the place of tryst.
</p>

<p>
Sweeping down glen and corrie, the night wind
came in squally gusts to furrow up the waters of
the Loch.  About the bare summits of the mighty
mountains which overlooked it, the red sheet-lightning
gleamed at times, giving a weird aspect to the
black and silent scenery, as rock, hill, and tree
came forth for a moment in dark outlines upon the
lurid background, and then vanished into obscurity.
</p>

<p>
No sound broke the solemn stillness save those
gusts of wind, or the rushing cascade of the
mountain burn that brawled from Inversnaid over rocks
and stones towards the loch, while the MacGregors
arriving in parties of ten, twenty&mdash;even forty&mdash;from
the banks of Loch Arclet, from Glengyle,
Glenstrae, and the braes of Balquhidder, mustered
at the appointed place, every man armed with
sword and dirk, target and pistol.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these (the invariable weapons of
the Highlander) many had long muskets with
bayonets, taken from the troops, and the terrible
<i>tuagh</i>, or pole-axe, and each wore a sprig of pine in
his bonnet.
</p>

<p>
A wild and warlike yet resolute band, they were
anxious for the conflict, as they had the traditionary
and actual wrongs of their race to avenge&mdash;the
violation of their clan territory; and, moreover,
many of them had suffered by the spoliation or
appropriation of their cattle and sheep, which had
been taken or shot by the king's garrison; for,
as stated elsewhere, cattle were then the whole
wealth of our mountaineers.  Forty head were a
woman's dowry; the rents were paid, daughters
were portioned, and sons provided for in life by
herds and flocks.
</p>

<p>
With MacAleister, Greumoch, Alaster Roy, Rob
found his eldest son Coll already there.  There,
too, came even old Paul Crubach, armed with the
hiltless sword on which he had impaled the unfortunate
cat; and on reckoning his force, Rob found
that it consisted of five hundred and two claymores,
all men resolute and true as the steel of which their
weapons were made.
</p>

<p>
The milky light of the stars glimmered at times
through the flying clouds, on their swords and
round shields studded with polished nails and
bosses of brass and steel, as they sat or stood in
picturesque groups, muttering and whispering, and
chewing the <i>muilcionn</i>, as the Highlanders name
the spignel, which they were wont to chew like
liquorice or quids of tobacco, in winter and spring.
</p>

<p>
Measures for the attack were soon resolved on by
a force alike destitute of cannon, petards, or
scaling-ladders.  They were simply these: To advance to
the gate in the ancient and classic form of a wedge,
led by Rob Roy; and if Oina had failed to remove
or overcome the sentinel, to trust to the
sledge-hammer first and the sword-blade after.
</p>

<p>
Those nearest in blood, highest in rank in the
clan, and the best armed, were to keep close by
Rob in the conflict; so Coll, MacAleister, and
Greumoch were immediately in his rear, as the
march was begun in silence up the side of the
stream, towards the point of attack.
</p>

<p>
The cuarans, or shoes of untanned deerskin, then
worn by-the Highlanders, strapped sandalwise over
the instep and ankles, enabled this mass of men to
advance over the rocky and rough ground as
silently and noiselessly as if they trod on the soft
heather, or on "the down of Cana," the cotton
grass of which Ossian sang, and which whitens the
Highland mosses in spring, when the sheep crop it,
before it bursts into flower.
</p>

<p>
After a march of something less than a mile,
before them, on an eminence, rose the strong walls
and black outline of the fort and barrack they were
about to assail.
</p>

<p>
Halting his men at some distance, MacGregor
crept forward softly and drew near the arched gate,
on each side of which three pieces of cannon
frowned through embrasures of stone.
</p>

<p>
He listened intently for the step of the sentinel
within, but heard only the wind, as it moaned past
the mouths of the cannon.
</p>

<p>
He uttered a shrill whistle like that of a curlew,
a signal he had agreed on with Oina, and her
expected response, three knocks on the gate, made
his heart leap, for he now knew that the sentinel
had fallen into a snare, that she had succeeded in
intoxicating him, and that the outer barrier at
least was open.  Hastening back to his men, he
exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come on, my lads, and follow me; the path
is clear!"
</p>

<p>
He drew his sword, and a gleam of light seemed
to pass over all the dusky mass as every man
followed his example, and rushing on like a living
flood, they flung themselves against the gate,
within which the sentinel was lying in his box quite
intoxicated.
</p>

<p>
With shouts of "Dhia agus ar duthaich!  Bigh
Hamish gu bragh!" ("God and our country!
King James for ever!") the MacGregors burst into
the fort; but, unknown to them, there was, an
inner gate of iron, which secured the passage to the
barracks.  This, Captain Clifford, the officer
commanding the main guard, instantly shut and secured;
and through the bars of it his men opened a fire
of musketry, that in five minutes brought the whole
garrison under arms.
</p>

<p>
Swinging ponderous sledge-hammers, Rob Roy,
MacAleister, and others, strove in vain to beat or
break down the malleable iron bars of this
unexpected barrier, through which the musketry flashed
incessantly, and many of their men were falling
killed or wounded, while others returned the fire
with their long guns, which they discharged
through the barrier right into the faces of the
redcoats.
</p>

<p>
The outworks of Inversnaid were completely in
possession of the MacGregors, but the inner wall,
by its height, defied their efforts, and Rob knew
that from it and the barrack windows ere long there
would be opened a fire of musketry, which would
decimate and destroy his men, unless the heart of
the place was entered, while consternation existed
in the garrison.
</p>

<p>
Already the windows were full of lights, as the
soldiers were dressing and arming in haste.  Sharply
and rapidly the long roll was beaten on the drum, and
scores of voices were heard in clamour and confusion
within, while without rang the wild cheers of
his men and the pipes of Alpine, who played,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Oh that I had three <i>hands</i>,&mdash;<br>
  One for the sword and two for the pipe!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The red explosion of muskets and pistols echoed
on both sides of the barrier, which Captain Clifford,
a resolute officer, who shared with his men a hatred
and fear of the Celts, defended with resolution;
expecting only extermination if taken, the King's
Fusiliers acted with great vigour and courage.
</p>

<p>
From an angle of the inner wall, which his men
were now rapidly lining, Major Huske shot off a
number of lighted shells or bombs from a little
brass howitzer.  These soared through the air,
forming long and dazzling arcs of light, which
enabled his Fusiliers to see the number and
disposition of the attacking force, and to direct their
fire upon the tumultuous mass of men wedged
below the walls, where the long blades of their
brandished swords seemed to flash sharply up from
a sea of blue bonnets, red tartans, and round
targets.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers, in their square-skirted red coats,
white cross-belts, and three-cornered hats, were
rapidly lining all the walls, firing at random as they
came upon the platforms, till Huske lighted three
<i>cercles goudronnes</i>, by the blaze of which they
directed their aim.
</p>

<p>
These are old gunmatches, pieces of rope dipped
in pitch and tar, made up in the form of a
circle, to be placed upon ramparts during a night
attack.
</p>

<p>
The clear light they cast upon the strife, together
with the sharp and destructive explosion of three or
four well directed hand-grenades, were causing great
consternation among the MacGregors, some twenty
or thirty of whom had fallen killed or wounded
when the bewildering cry of "<i>fire! fire!</i>" in the
heart of the garrison, produced a panic among the
soldiers, and a red blaze was seen to start above the
roof of the barracks.  In fact, Oina, to create a
diversion, and distract the attention of the defenders,
had thrown a lighted candle into the lofts, where
the hay and straw for the officers' horses were
stored.
</p>

<p>
A part of the wall was thus left undefended by
Huske drawing off his men to extinguish the flames.
At this part, the faithful and devoted Oina threw
down a ladder, up which the Highlanders scrambled
with the activity of wild cats; but at the same
moment a stray bullet pierced her head, and she
fell lifeless across the wall with her arms and her
long dark hair spread over it.
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy was the first man in!
</p>

<p>
As he placed a foot upon the parapet, he stumbled
and fell; but his figure and red beard had been
recognized by the light of the blazing <i>cercles
goudronnes</i>.
</p>

<p>
"The red MacGregor! down with him," exclaimed
an officer; "at him, my lads, with your
bayonets breast high!"
</p>

<p>
Four soldiers rushed forward, and Rob's life had
likely ended there, had not Eoin Raibaich (John the
Grizzled) a MacPherson who bore his standard (for
the Clan Vurich were the hereditary banner-bearers
of Clan Alpine), devotedly flung himself before him;
and after thrusting the point of the standard pole
into the heart of one soldier, received the bayonet
of a second on his target, and those of the other
two in his own gallant breast.
</p>

<p>
"Righ Hamish gu bragh!" he exclaimed, and
expired, as Greumoch snatched the banner from his
hand.  Then Rob Roy leaped down into the heart
of the place, and with shouts of triumph and fury,
his men spread over the whole barrack.
</p>

<p>
Paul Crubach was seen hobbling hither and
thither, yelling like a fiend; his cross-staff uplifted
in one hand, his rusty sword-blade in the other, and
his long white hair streaming behind, and glittering
like hoar frost in the blaze of the burning haylofts,
and the flashing of the musketry.
</p>

<p>
Captain Clifford finding the rear turned, and the
foe in the heart of the garrison, opened the inner
gate, and at the head of the main guard forced a
passage through and escaped.
</p>

<p>
By this avenue the whole garrison also escaped
or were expelled, being driven forth at the point of
the sword.  Many cast aside their muskets and belts,
and fled down the glen of Inversnaid, they knew not
whither; but had they been pursued in the old
Highland fashion, not one could have escaped; however,
Rob was merciful, and would not permit a man to
follow the fugitives.
</p>

<p>
Greumoch in the <i>mÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂªlÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©e</i> caught Major Huske by
his queue at the moment he was rushing sword in
hand through the gate of the fort.  The Celt was
about to hew the Saxon down, when the wig of the
latter came off, so he escaped bareheaded, while
Greumoch fell heavily on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Oich," muttered he; "prutt-trutt! he has a
sliddery grip that takes an eel by the tail."
</p>

<p>
MacAleister soon discovered the cell wherein
Ronald was confined, and he rushed forth to
embrace his father ere the fray was well over.
</p>

<p>
Rob's plaid was torn to pieces by bayonet
thrusts and musket balls, and he had a severe
wound in his left shoulder, where a captain, named
Dorrington, stabbed him through the gate with his
spontoon, a pike then carried by all officers.
</p>

<p>
Save about fifteen or twenty soldiers who lay
killed or wounded (chiefly near the iron gate), not
one of the garrison remained in Inversnaid; but the
barrack-yard was strewed with muskets, swords,
cartridge-boxes, blankets, haversacks, hats, and
wigs; and there also lay two drums, for the fugitives
in their panic and desire to escape abandoned
everything, even to their regimental colour, for a
standard of the South British Fusiliers was found
in Major Huske's quarters by young Coll MacGregor,
having the English rose embroidered upon
it, together with the white horse of Hanover, and
the motto, <i>Nec aspera terant</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Carry this to the farm of Portnellan, my
boys," said Rob to his sons, "and give it to
your mother as a trophy of this night's work.  She
has wept and wearied long for you, Ronald."
</p>

<p>
As there was no time to be lost, he gave orders
to destroy the fort utterly.  The wounded were
carefully removed, and the slain MacGregors he
sent by a boat for interment on Inchcailloch,
beside the ruined church, which had been disused
since 1621.
</p>

<p>
Among these was Oina, whom her husband had
rolled in his plaid, as the only shroud and coffin he
had time to procure her.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the plunder found in the barracks
and stores&mdash;arms, powder, clothing, food, and
money&mdash;Rob Roy, with his characteristic
generosity, gave to his poor and faithful followers,
which completely consoled them for many a stab,
slash, and bruise received in the attack.
</p>

<p>
To himself he reserved only the captured standard
and a little child&mdash;a boy of about three years of
age&mdash;who was found asleep peacefully in his bed
amid all the horrid din and hurly-burly of the night
assault and capture.
</p>

<p>
On inquiring among the wounded soldiers whose
boy this was, Rob was informed that he was the
only son of Major Huske; so he gave the little
fellow in care of his foster-brother, MacAleister, saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well, major, turn about is fair play.  You took
my son&mdash;I now take yours.  Carry him to Portnellan,
Callam, and give him to Helen.  Tell her
(but it is needless) to keep the little Saxon
tenderly, as if he were our own, till such time as
we can restore him to his father."
</p>

<p>
So MacAleister wrapped his plaid about the
child, who screamed with terror on seeing the
Highlanders; for it was a common belief then in
England, and for long after, that they were wont
to eat children, like the ogres of the fairy tales.
</p>

<p>
Rob next ordered the cannon to be spiked and
the barracks to be set on fire.
</p>

<p>
"Alpine, strike up the <i>Brattach Ghael</i>!" said he
to the piper, who at once began the "White
Banner," a famous pibroch of the Jacobite clans.
"By the deed of to-night I shall teach these robber
Whigs and truckling Lowlanders to consider well
ere again they build a fort on our land; this will
be the worst twist in their cow's-horn!"
</p>

<p>
Rob now gave orders to retire, with the wounded
slung in plaids over the shoulders of their comrades,
who applied handfuls of nettles to stop the bleeding
of cuts and stabs; and the retreating MacGregors
saw the flames of the burning barrack and fort
rising like a pyramid of fire above the walls, as the
daylight stole down the vast steeps of Ben Lomond
into its solemn glens and rocky corries.
</p>

<p>
The blaze was yet shining across the grey
morning sky, when they retreated to their
fastnesses at the head of Loch Katrine, by the wild
way of Loch Arclet, whither MacGregor believed
the bravest men in the castles of Stirling or
Dumbarton dared not follow him!

THE FIGHT AT ABERFOYLE.
</h3>

<p>
The little boy found at Inversnaid was kindly and
tenderly received by Helen MacGregor, who made
him share the heather-couch of her youngest son,
Duncan, a hardy little Highland colt, who was
about the same age as the yellow-haired Saxon.
The arrival of the latter created great speculation
in the small clachan or farm-town of Portnellan;
but the poor boy, accustomed to other sights and
sounds than those around him now, was scared and
terrified by the aspect of the Highlanders, and
mourned for his father and for the soldiers among
whom he had been reared, and clung to the skirts
of Helen MacGregor as his only protectress.
</p>

<p>
However, as children so young have but shallow
griefs and short memories, a few days found him
quite reconciled to his fortune, to little Duncan as a
bedfellow and playmate; and he learned to sup his
porridge with a horn spoon from a large wooden
trencher, and to make a companion of the stag-hounds,
collies, and otter-terriers, that shared the
fireside and sitting-room of the family of Portnellan.
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" said Helen, one evening, as she sat
with the little stranger on her knee; "this fair boy
is too sweet, too good and beautiful to find a proper
place on earth."
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;what mean ye, goodwife?" asked Rob,
with displeasure.
</p>

<p>
"Such children never live to comb grey hairs."
</p>

<p>
"Say not so, Helen," said Rob, impressed by
her manner.
</p>

<p>
"I would the youngling was with his own people.
I judge of their sufferings by what I myself have
suffered," said Helen, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"True, Helen," said Rob Roy, sternly, as he sat
at the table oiling the locks of his pistols; "but
little cared they for our heartaches when Ronald
was their prisoner&mdash;fettered like a felon in the
port of Inversnaid, because he fished on the
patrimony of his father, and scorned to betray him for
gold!"
</p>

<p>
"To seek the major at Dumbarton&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To seek Major Huske anywhere would be to
seek death, even for him who took the child to him.
A dab MacAleister gave him with his dirk is not
likely to have improved the major's temper; so let
us bide our time, Helen.  Our Highland air but ill
suits Saxon lungs, yet the blue-eyed boy thrives
bravely, and our little Duncan loves him well.  They
share their bannocks and cheese, their brochan and
brose, like sons of the same mother."
</p>

<p>
"Yet I would the child were with his," said
Helen, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"She is, I hope, in heaven," said Rob, looking
upward.
</p>

<p>
"Dead!" exclaimed Helen; "mean you that she
is dead?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Helen, even so.  She was killed by a
cannon-ball at the siege of Landau, in the Lowlands
of Holland; and the poor child, then at her breast,
was covered with her blood.  Thus, poor Oina, who
heard a soldier say so, told me."
</p>

<p>
Helen's eyes filled with tears, as she kissed and
caressed the motherless boy, who, while creeping
close to her, always viewed her husband's red
flowing beard, glaring tartans, and glittering
weapons (which he could scarcely lay aside for a
moment, even by his own hearthstone) with an
undisguised fear and mistrust that frequently made
Rob and his henchman laugh heartily.
</p>

<p>
Helen dressed little Harry Huske in a home-made
kilt and short coat, which she adorned with buttons
formed of those remarkable pebbles which are found
on the isle of Iona.  Her own hardy boys never
wore shoes except in winter, and then she fashioned
for them soft warm <i>cuarans</i> of the red-deer's hide,
to protect their feet from the snow; but to little
Harry, having been more gently nurtured, she gave
every luxury their circumstances would admit, and
nightly she sang him to sleep with her harp, and
the plaintive old song of MacGregor na Ruara.
</p>

<p>
Assisted and protected by Sir Humphry Colquhoun,
James Grant of Pluscardine, and others,
Major Huske, though severely wounded, with all
his half-disarmed fugitives, reached the castle of
Dumbarton, which is more than twenty miles from
Inversnaid, and from thence in a few days, by order
of Lieutenant-General Carpenter, commander-in-chief
in Scotland, a company of grenadiers, and
three of the line, were ordered to penetrate into
the district of the MacGregors, to punish them,
and, if possible, to capture Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
This party, notice of whose march was speedily
brought to Portnellan by Coll MacGregor and
Greumoch, who had been scouting among the hills
of Buchanan, was commanded by Captain Clifford,
whose residence at Inversnaid had rendered him
pretty conversant with the country.  The tidings
filled Helen and her household with something very
like dismay; but her husband fearlessly prepared
for the emergency, and resolved to meet the
invaders in one of those narrow passes which then
formed the only avenues to the Highlands&mdash;avenues
which no foreign sword had ever been able to
open up.
</p>

<p>
Clifford's detachment consisted of picked men of
the South British Fusiliers, all burning to avenge
the late affair at Inversnaid and the loss of their
regimental colour.  As incentives to them, the price
of Rob Roy's head, the entire spoil&mdash;cattle, arms,
and goods of his adherents&mdash;were given in prospective;
thus, they commenced the expedition with
great alacrity; and the noon of the third day after
quitting Dumbarton saw them crossing the mountains
near Gartmore House, and approaching the
pass of Aberfoyle, intending by that circuitous
route to penetrate towards Loch Ard and the
Trossachs, and then fall suddenly in the night on Rob
Roy's quarters.
</p>

<p>
They required no guide, as Captain Clifford
alleged that he had shot and fished over all the
district, and knew it very well.
</p>

<p>
Brightly shone the steel bayonets and polished
musket-barrels in the setting sun of the May
evening, and the redcoats looked gay and gallant,
while chatting and singing, for no fife was blown
nor drum beaten when the strong detachment of
Captain Clifford entered the valley of Aberfoyle;
but little knew he what awaited him between the
Trossachs and Loch Katrine!
</p>

<p>
Clifford, a brave, handsome officer, rode at the
head of the Grenadiers, mounted on a fine white
charger.  He was a good horseman, and sat well in
his saddle.  They seemed intended for each other,
steed and rider; both seemed to have high spirit
and good blood in them; and, in sooth, the steep
and rugged mountain path they had to traverse put
both to the test.
</p>

<p>
He had a red feather in his cocked hat, and the
snow-white curls of his regimental Ramillies wig
flowed over the low cut collar of his wide-skirted
scarlet coat.  He wore fine lace ruffles, and long
black riding-boots.
</p>

<p>
The Grenadiers had all conical caps of blue
cloth, shaped like episcopal mitres, but with scarlet
flaps in front, whereon was worked in worsted
the white horse of Hanover.  Their wide skirts
and loose sleeves were all looped up, and they
marched with their pouches open and fuses in their
hands.
</p>

<p>
The rest had their bayonets fixed and arms
loaded.
</p>

<p>
Ere long the silence of the vast solitude on which
they were entering&mdash;the utter absence of all
appearance of life or inhabitants&mdash;made Captain
Clifford begin to dread a surprise.  Anon, even
the voices of his men died away; they began to
speak in whispers, and as the purple shadows
deepened amid that tremendous mountain scenery,
they kept closer in their ranks, and looked anxiously
about them, and at the narrow pass in front.
</p>

<p>
The arms taken at Inversnaid had, more than
ever, completely equipped the Clan Gregor; so
now, in the gloomy gorge of Aberfoyle, one of the
greatest barriers between the Gael and the
Lowlander, were posted in ambush one hundred and
sixty marksmen armed with muskets.  Under
Alaster Roy and Coll, eighty manned one side of
the pass, and as many under Greumoch were on
the other.
</p>

<p>
There, too, was little Ronald, crouching among
the thick heather, armed with a long horse-pistol,
and intent on deadly mischief, if he could see Major
Huske, whom he vowed should pay dear for his
basket of trout.
</p>

<p>
Well did Rob and his men know that, if
conquered, death and decimation awaited them,
together with the utter ruin&mdash;it might be the
<i>extirpation</i>&mdash;of their families: for the terrible
massacre at Glencoe was still fresh in all their
memories.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, they remembered that this spot was
one of good augury; for there, in the days of their
grandsires, a fierce encounter took place with a
body of Cromwell's soldiers, who were cut to pieces,
and some of whom were buried in a grave which yet
remains by the wayside.
</p>

<p>
Under Rob Roy in person, the main body of his
men lay concealed right in front of the marching
soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Sombre twilight was stealing now across the
deeper glens, but a bright glory of sunshine yet
lighted the vast mountain cones that towered above
the valley.
</p>

<p>
Clifford and his officers frequently uttered
exclamations expressive of admiration, for the vale of
Aberfoyle, with its splintered rocks, abrupt precipices,
and richly-wooded hills, is singularly beautiful;
but when Loch Ard began to open its sheet
of water on their view, gleaming like a golden
shield in the last light of the western sky, the scene
became more lovely still.
</p>

<p>
The dusky <i>iolar</i> was seen winging his way to his
eyry in the craggy steeps; and the sweet notes of
the <i>druidhu</i>, or Alpine blackbird, rang loudly from
the hazel woods; while the wild goat, perched on a
sharp pinnacle, with his long beard floating on the
wind, looked down on the marching troops.
</p>

<p>
Above hills covered with oak and birch, that
waved in the evening breeze like ostrich plumes,
above even the saffron clouds, Ben Lomond towered
into the grey mist; and far across the placid lake
fell its shadow with that of the isle that holds the
ruined tower of Murdoch, Duke of Albany; while
far in the distance rose the Alps of Arroquhar, with
their summits hid in mist, or capped still with the
last year's snow.
</p>

<p>
Such was the scene that opened beyond the
dark and narrow defile on which the soldiers were
entering.
</p>

<p>
"A sergeant and three men to the front&mdash;double
quick!" cried Captain Clifford, as certain
undefinable suspicions crossed his mind on seeing that
some large boulder-stones had been dislodged from
the rocks above, and were hurled down on the
narrow pathway, as if to form a barricade.
"Grenadiers," he added, "blow your fuses; be ready to
throw your grenades, and fall on at a moment's
notice."
</p>

<p>
Still nothing was seen, though five hundred men
and more were crouching within musket
range&mdash;crouching amid the long green braken, the thick
purple heather, and the wild bloom which grew so
luxuriantly that the crows and magpies built their
nests in it; but the tartans of the Highlanders
blended with the colours of Nature so admirably
that they were still unseen, when at last the whole
detachment, officers and men, were <i>between</i> the
muzzles of the musketeers who lay in ambush
on both sides of that narrow and gloomy gorge,
and already the sergeant and his three advanced
files were clambering over the boulders and stones
that lay beyond the ambush.
</p>

<p>
Before MacGregor's horn could give the signal,
his son Ronald, unable longer to restrain his anger
and enthusiasm, fired his pistol, and the ball struck
Clifford's holsters.
</p>

<p>
Then red fire flashed fiercely from both sides of
the dusky hollow, as a hundred and sixty muskets
poured their adverse volleys on the unfortunate
soldiers, who in a moment were panic-stricken,
thrown into confusion&mdash;a huddled mass&mdash;above
their dead and dying.
</p>

<p>
Springing from amid the grey rocks, the
MacGregors, with a simultaneous shout, flung
down their plaids and muskets, drew their
claymores, and amid the white curling smoke, rushed
downward to the charge.
</p>

<p>
"Steady, men, steady!" cried Captain Clifford,
loudly and rapidly.  "Grenadiers to the centre!
Keep shoulder to shoulder, and face outwards&mdash;close
up in your ranks, and bayonet them as they
come on!  Be firm, my Royal Fusiliers!"
</p>

<p>
"Firm, in the king's name, and we shall yet
bear back these Highland savages!" added
Captain Dorrington, a brave officer who had served
in the war of the Spanish succession.
</p>

<p>
Leaping over bank, bush, and rock, with heads
stooped behind their targets in the usual Celtic
fashion, their bodies bent, and sword and dirk in
hand, down came the MacGregors, in front
and on both flanks, like a herd of wild cats,
all yelling, "Ard choille! ard choille!  Dhia agus
ar duthaich!"
</p>

<p>
A confused volley was fired by the soldiers; but
almost before the bayonets could be brought from
the "present" to the "charge," the swordsmen
were among them.  Stooping below the charged
bayonets, they tossed them upward by the target,
dirking the front rank men with the left hand,
while stabbing or hewing down the rear rank men
with the right; thus, as usual in all Highland
onsets, the whole body of soldiers was broken, trod
underfoot, and dispersed in a moment!
</p>

<p>
These were the whole tactics of the Scottish
Highlanders.  Hence their clan battles, no matter
how many swordsmen might be engaged, seldom
lasted more than five minutes.  It was usually an
instantaneous charge&mdash;a rout&mdash;a killing, and all
was over!
</p>

<p>
Captain Dorrington rushed sword in hand upon
Greumoch, who, by a single blow with his Lochaber
axe, clove him literally through hat and wig to the
teeth; then, by the hook of the same weapon, he
dragged Captain Clifford from his saddle, and
would have slain him had not Rob Roy strode
across the fallen officer, and by receiving the blow
on his own target, saved him.
</p>

<p>
Several soldiers, who had burst out of the
press, leaped behind rocks and stones, from whence
they opened a desultory fire; but they were soon
pursued, and cut down or pistolled.
</p>

<p>
The whole detachment would have been destroyed
in a few minutes, had not Rob Roy, towering over
the throng, shouted in English, and with a voice
that rose above the shrieks and shouts, the clash of
weapons, and explosion of firearms, which woke a
thousand echoes in the narrow pass, the overhanging
rocks and mountains,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Surrender, yield&mdash;lay down your arms! on
your lives lay them down, and I promise you all
quarter,&mdash;I, the Red MacGregor!"
</p>

<p>
On hearing this, his own men partly drew back,
and many a claymore was withdrawn from a thrust,
or lowered from a cut, and the firing instantly
ceased.
</p>

<p>
"You hear what I have said, Captain Clifford,"
exclaimed Rob Roy; "to resist now is to court
death.  I know you are too brave a soldier to deem
rashness is valour."
</p>

<p>
"Unfix your bayonets, my lads, and ground
your arms.  Grenadiers, extinguish your matches,"
cried Captain Clifford, sullenly.  "Our time for
sure vengeance shall come anon.  But what manner
of man are <i>you</i>, sir," he added, turning fiercely
to Rob Roy, "who dare thus attack the king's
troops on the open highway?"
</p>

<p>
"The pass of Aberfoyle, which leads to the
country of Clan Alpine, is <i>not</i> an open highway,
as you, captain, have found to your cost; and as
for me, I am the man your king and laws have
made me," replied MacGregor, sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, is not our king yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, sir.  You serve the Elector of Hanover.
Our king is far away in France, beyond the sea;
but we are his true liege men, nevertheless.  We
have no time to spend in talking, captain.  The
night darkens fast, and the sooner your men with
the wounded get out of the Highland bounds the
better.  Do not be cast down, my friends," said
he, still speaking English to the prisoners, who
were now huddled together in a crowd, and
surrounded by the armed MacGregors; "you are not
the first men who have come into the Highlands to
shear, and have gone home closely shorn."
</p>

<p>
"But your terms: our fate, Mr. Rob Roy Campbell?"
began Clifford, in a blundering way.
</p>

<p>
"'Sdeath and fury!" exclaimed Rob; "call
me Campbell again, and I shall cleave you to the
belt!"
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me; but I do not understand all this,"
said the officer; "are you not named MacGregor
Campbell?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; by tyrannical acts of Parliament, which
I treat with the scorn they merit."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir; your terms?"
</p>

<p>
"Are these,&mdash;Surrender your arms and ammunition;
leave the Highland border, and begone to
England or the Lowlands; let us see you no more
in the country of the Clan Gregor."
</p>

<p>
"The Lowlands," said Clifford, haughtily; "sir,
we are quartered in the castle of Dumbarton."
</p>

<p>
"Where you are quartered, captain, is nothing
to me."
</p>

<p>
"There will be a bloody reckoning for this," said
Clifford through his clenched teeth, as he gazed
sadly on the mangled body of his poor friend and
comrade, Captain Dorrington.  "Chief, have you
no fear for the future?"
</p>

<p>
"I fear nothing," replied Rob, haughtily; "moreover
I am no chief, but a simple Highland gentleman,
whom wrong and tyranny have driven to
desperation.  You have yet to learn, sir, that
though the king may create a titled noble, Heaven
alone can make a Highland chief."
</p>

<p>
The English officer shrugged his shoulders, and
gave a disdainful smile, for to his ears this sounded
like mere rhodomontade.
</p>

<p>
"To you, Captain Clifford," resumed Rob Roy,
"I return your sword.  The arms of your men I
retain for the service of King James and the
protection of my own people.  I restore you all to
liberty; but bear this message to the Saxon
Governor of Dumbarton, to General Carpenter,
or whoever sent you hither, that of the next band
which on a hostile errand enters the country of
Rob Roy, not one shall return alive if I can help
it&mdash;<i>not one</i>, by the blessed God of my forefathers,
and by St. Colme of Iona, for they shall be cut
off root and branch, and the eagle of the hill shall
alone tell their fate."  He pressed his bare dirk to
his lips as he spoke, and many of his men followed
the example.  "Go, sir; and may we never meet
again.  My foster-brother, with a hundred of my
men, shall escort you so far as Bucklyvie to assist
in bearing your wounded.  After reaching that
place you will be safe from all molestation.
Farewell.  Strike up, Alpine!" he said to the piper,
while saluting the captain with one hand and
sheathing his sword with the other.
</p>

<p>
Then, as the disarmed band of soldiers, after
getting, by Rob's orders, a good dram of whisky
each, carrying or supporting their wounded, and
escorted by MacAleister with a hundred picked
men, proceeded in the shadowy gloaming down
the dark and rugged pass of Aberfoyle, Alpine's
great warpipe woke its many echoes with the
triumphant pibroch of "Glenfruin."
</p>

<p>
Only two MacGregors were killed, so instantaneous
had been their onset; but ten redcoats lay
dead in the pass; and these the MacGregors
buried with reverence by the wayside, where their
tomb may yet be seen.
</p>

<p>
Encouraged by this victory to attempt greater
enterprises, MacGregor now resolved to break
down into the Lowlands, to carry off the spoil of
his enemies; and remembering that it was about
the time when the rents of his great enemy the
Duke of Montrose were collected, he conceived
the idea of visiting the chamberlain on the
rent-day&mdash;of putting the whole money in his own
pocket, and, to punish his grace for old scores,
to carry off the obnoxious Killearn bodily into the
mountains.
</p>

<p>
"As the runnels from a hundred hills unite in
one, and form a mighty stream," said he, in a
stirring address to his followers, "so must all the
branches of our outraged people now converge in
one.  From Glengyle and Glenstrae, from Menteith
and Balquhidder, let us muster and march&mdash;march
down on those sons of little men, the Lowlanders;
and they shall shrink before us like dry leaves
beneath the lightning!  Our forefathers sleep on
Inchcailloch; but we, alas! must find our graves
on the mountain side, where nothing shall mark
them to future times but a grey cairn or a greener
spot amid the purple heather."
</p>

<p>
"Down on the mongrel bodachs&mdash;down on the
Whigamores!" responded his followers, brandishing
their swords with almost savage glee; for to
the Highlander then the single word Whig
expressed the acme of anything that was sordid,
mean, and treacherous to king and country.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI.
<br><br>
ROB SEIZES THE RENTS OF MONTROSE.
</h3>

<p>
It was about the middle of summer in the year
1717, when Rob Roy, leaving the main body of
his followers, under his son Coll, posted among the
hills of Buchanan, where they had collected a
great herd of cattle, the spoil of their hereditary
enemies, set forth with twenty men and his favourite
piper, Alpine, on a visit to Killearn.
</p>

<p>
MacAleister and Greumoch were, of course,
among these chosen twenty, who were literally his
<i>Leine a chrios</i>&mdash;the select men of his followers,
meaning in English his "shirt of mail," or children
of the belt&mdash;men at all times ready to support,
obey, defend, or die for him.
</p>

<p>
Fearing that Killearn might obtain tidings of his
approach, and take to flight with his grace of
Montrose's money, Rob marched towards his residence
with great secrecy and rapidity; and avoiding
the highways passed through woods and defiles,
and about twelve in the forenoon presented himself
suddenly at the Place of Killearn, as Grahame's
mansion is still named.
</p>

<p>
It stands a mile and a half south of the village
of Killearn, at the western extremity of Strathblane,
in Stirlingshire, and having been built in 1688,
it was then surrounded by clumps of wood and
plantations.
</p>

<p>
Here MacGregor was informed by the terrified
household that the laird was at the Inn of
Chapelerroch, where the tenantry of the duke had been
summoned to pay their rents; so he departed at
once, with a threat, that if they deceived him, he
would return and burn the house to the ground.
</p>

<p>
He soon reached the inn, which stands half-way
between Buchanan House (the duke's residence)
and the village of Drymen; and close by it he
placed his men in a copsewood.
</p>

<p>
Killearn, with many of the duke's tenants, was
in the dining-room, and he had already given
receipts for a large sum of money, when the sound
of a bagpipe was heard approaching.  The air
played, "Up wi' the Campbells and down wi' the
Grahames," betokening something hostile, they
hurried to the windows, and great was the
consternation of Killearn when he beheld Rob Roy,
but alone, or preceded only by the piper, Alpine,
advancing straight to the door of the inn.
</p>

<p>
Though in terror that his own life might be the
forfeit of the proceedings instituted against Rob
nine years before, he sought to preserve his master's
property, and gathering up his rent-rolls, receipts,
and the bags containing the money, he flung them
into a loft above the room.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the door was thrown open, and
with a respect that was in no way assumed, the
landlord ushered in Rob Roy, fully armed, with
a smile on his lip and irony in his clear grey eye,
while Alpine remained as a sentinel at the entrance
of the inn.
</p>

<p>
"God save all here!" said MacGregor, bowing.
</p>

<p>
"A hundred thousand welcomes!" replied Killearn,
whose dapper little figure trembled in his
buckled shoes, and he nervously fingered the
breeches bible that was always in one of the large
flapped pockets of his square-skirted black velvet
coat.  He trembled so much that the powder of
his wig floated like a cloud about his head, as it
was shaken from the curls.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion, Rob wore a short green jacket
profusely laced with silver; a long red waistcoat,
and scarlet woollen shirt open at the neck; a belted
plaid, and pair of deerskin hose and cuarans
elaborately cut and tied with thongs.  His sporan was
ornamented with silver and closed by a curious lock,
which concealed two pistol barrels that were always
loaded, and would infallibly blow to pieces the
hands of any person attempting to open it while
ignorant of its secret springs.  (This singular clasp
is now preserved in the Museum of Antiquities at
Edinburgh.)  In his bonnet was a long eagle's
feather, a tuft of pine, and the proscribed white
cockade.
</p>

<p>
His lawless and predatory life had imparted a
wild expression to his eye and a boldness to his
bearing that impressed all present; but one of
the duke's farmers, named MacLaren, gathering
courage, pushed a bottle of wine and another
of whisky towards him, saying, with affected
confidence,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You will drink with us, MacGregor?"
</p>

<p>
"That will I do, blithely," replied Rob, as he
filled up a silver quaich with whisky, and drank it
off, previously giving the old Highland toast,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The Hills, the Glens, and <i>the People</i>!"
</p>

<p>
He then laid his sword and pistols on the table,
and presenting his little crooked snuff-mull to go
round the company, in token of amity, he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Keep your seats gentlemen, pray; do not let
me interrupt you," and proceeded to partake of the
cold roasted meat, the bread, cheese, and wine
which had been provided as a repast for the
tenants, about thirty of whom were in the room.
</p>

<p>
While Rob was eating, the spirits of the party
rose, and the bottle went cheerfully round till he
called to the piper, who stood outside the inn near
the open windows,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Alpine, strike up <i>Glenfruin</i>."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this order, which seemed the forerunner
of mischief, the chamberlain and tenants
exchanged glances of uneasiness, which in no way
subsided when Rob stuck his pistols in his belt and
snatched his sword, as his henchman and other
followers burst into the room, with claymores
drawn, and ranged themselves at the door and
windows, precluding all chances of escape.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Killearn," said Rob, for the first time
addressing his enemy; "you will perhaps have the
kindness to inform me how you have come on with
your collection of his grace's rents?"
</p>

<p>
Hesitation and fear made the factor silent.
</p>

<p>
"Speak!" exclaimed Rob, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"I have got nothing yet," stammered Killearn.
</p>

<p>
"How! nothing from all this goodly company?"
asked Rob, with a deepening frown.
</p>

<p>
"I have not yet begun to collect."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, chamberlain; I know you of old,
and so your tricks and falsehoods will not pass with
me.  I must reckon with you fairly by the book.
Produce at once your ledger!"
</p>

<p>
Killearn, with the perspiration oozing on his
temples, still hesitated and began to protest; but
Rob laid his watch on the table, and cocking one of
his steel pistols, said, with assumed calmness,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Killearn, I give you but three minutes to reflect
and to obey me."
</p>

<p>
In terror of death the chamberlain grew deadly
pale and looked sick at heart, while a glassy stare
dimmed both his eyes, which wandered from the
dial of the watch to the muzzle of the pistol, and
then to the blank faces of the shrinking farmers,
who were seated at the table as if rooted to
their chairs.
</p>

<p>
"One minute has already passed," said Rob, as
he began to hum an air, a sure sign that further
mischief was not far off; so Killearn, seeing the
utter futility of resistance, produced his rental-book
and bags of money.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Killearn, this is acting like a sensible
man," said Rob Roy as he uncocked the pistol and
placed the watch in his pocket; "so help yourself
and take a dram, while I examine your accounts."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap32"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII.
<br><br>
KILLEARN CARRIED OFF.
</h3>

<p>
Rob Roy turned over leaf after leaf of the ledger,
examined the whole of the rental, drew from the
farmers those sums which the chamberlain had
not yet received, and, pocketing a total of
ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£3,227. 2s. 8d. (Scots), with great formality
granted receipts in full.
</p>

<p>
"I will have a due count and reckoning," said
he, "with the Duke of Montrose, when his grace
repays me the sum of 3,400 merks Scots&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For what?" asked Killearn, gathering courage.
</p>

<p>
"Dare <i>you</i> ask me for what?  For the havoc
made on my property by the troops whom Lord
Cadogan sent to Craigrostan, and to burn my
dwelling-house at Auchinchisallan; to say nothing
of the heirship of my lands at Inversnaid.  When
all these damages have been repaired and repaid, I
will then consider the <i>older</i> scores (anent our
unlucky cattle speculation) that exist between your
master and me."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose all this were done," said Killearn,
"would you give up your predatory habits, which
keep the whole Highland border in hot water; and
would you teach your people those of industry?"
</p>

<p>
"Killearn, as for predatory habits, think you a
Highlander ever felt his conscience prick him for
taking <i>spreaths</i> of cattle from his natural foemen
the Lowlanders?  And as for habits of industry, a
kilted duinewassal at a shop-counter, or seated at
the loom, would be like an eagle in a cage, or a
red-deer yoked to a plough," said Rob, with an
angry laugh.
</p>

<p>
"How will this wild life of yours end, MacGregor?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Not</i> where you anxiously wish it may end&mdash;on
the gallows-tree; but it shall end when our wrongs
are righted."
</p>

<p>
"At civil law you have&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What!" interrupted MacGregor, with a fierce
and hollow laugh, "would you have me, upon
whose head a price has been set for these nine
years past, sneak into the Lawyers' Court at
Dunedin, among truculent Whigs and psalm-singing
pharisees, to crave and beg the restoration of
my patrimony?  The hills, with all their woods
and waters, were given to the Gael in the days of
old, to be their dwelling-place and inheritance, and
none but He hath a right to deprive us of them."
</p>

<p>
"Then we part in peace, MacGregor?" urged
Killearn.
</p>

<p>
"Part&mdash;far from it, my good chamberlain,"
said Rob.
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked Killearn, uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"I must have the pleasure of your company with
me into the Highlands."
</p>

<p>
Killearn again grew deadly pale, and faltered
out,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"To be kept as a hostage until Montrose pays
me the sum of 3,400 merks which he is justly
owing me."
</p>

<p>
"If he refuses?"
</p>

<p>
"Then, I will hang you, John Grahame of
Killearn, on the highest tree that grows by the
banks of Loch Katrine!  Away with him, Greumoch.
Good night, gentlemen all.  Alpine, strike
up; the <i>glomain</i> grows apace, and we must begone
to the mountains with speed."
</p>

<p>
In less than an hour after this the unfortunate
factor found himself on the march with Rob Roy's
men among the hills of Buchanan, from whence the
whole clan, with their spoil, departed under cloud
of night, by Auchintroig and Gartmore, and
through the pass of Aberfoyle towards the
Trossachs.
</p>

<p>
In irony the piper played before him all the way,
till, at a place near Loch Ard, Alpine suddenly
stopped as they passed a green knoll.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you pause?" asked MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
Alpine pointed to the green knoll.  It was a
haunt of the fairies, who had decoyed therein his
own grandfather, also a piper (for he played the
clan into the action at Glenfruin), and he was seen
no more till on a Halloween night, about fifty years
after.  His son, then an aged man, on passing, saw
the hillock open like a chamber, and his father,
still young and beardless, playing vigorously to
hundreds of quaint little dancers in green doublets
and conical hats.
</p>

<p>
On finding himself conveyed into that Highland
wilderness, whither few Lowlanders dared to
venture in those days, all hope for the future
died away in the heart of the unhappy Grahame of
Killearn.
</p>

<p>
Chance of escape he had none.  He was secured
by a rope round his waist, and this was tied to the
girdle of Greumoch MacGregor, who, regardless of
the failing strength and weak limbs of the dapper
little chamberlain, marched sullenly on, with his
poleaxe on his shoulder, a short tobacco-pipe in his
mouth, and his vast plaid floating behind him,
dragging his prisoner over rocks and stones, up
steep ascents and down foaming watercourses,
without pity or remorse, and without giving
him time either to breathe or implore rest and pity.
</p>

<p>
With growing terror Grahame remembered his
treatment of the wife of MacGregor, when he
pillaged Inversnaid, though under colour and
authority of the civil law; he knew that it was by
his counsels that the powerful Duke of Montrose
had ruined poor Rob, and driven him to the hillside
as an outlaw and reiver; and he gave himself
up for utterly lost when the wild pass of Aberfoyle
closed upon the rear of the marching band, and the
vast spoil of cattle they had collected at the point
of the sword.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br><br>
KILLEARN'S FATE.
</h3>

<p>
Rob Roy conveyed his prisoner to the head of Loch
Katrine, and by the time he arrived there, exhausted
by toil, by the rough nature of the steep paths he
had been forced to traverse with such unwonted
celerity, and moreover being in constant fear of a
dreadful death by hanging on a tree, being drowned
like a cur with a stone at his neck, or being shot by
a platoon of MacGregors, the unhappy Killearn was
in a deplorable plight, and had long since become
quite passive in the hands of his captors.
</p>

<p>
By order of Rob Roy, Greumoch placed him in a
boat, and rowed him to an island in the loch, now well
known to tourists as "Ellen's Isle;" it was covered
with the richest copsewood, and there, in a hut with
Greumoch and another equally grim Celt to watch
him, Killearn remained in captivity, during which
nothing was known of his fate in the Lowlands, until
he was permitted to write to the duke.
</p>

<p>
This letter, which he was compelled to date from
Chapelerroch, lest the real place of his detention
should become known, acquainted the duke that he
was the helpless prisoner of Rob Roy, who was
resolved to detain him until a ransom of 3,400
merks Scots was paid for the damage by Lord
Cadogan's troops at Craigrostan and Auchinchisallan;
adding, moreover, that he would receive "<i>hard
usage</i> if any military party was sent after him."
</p>

<p>
In breathless suspense poor Mr. Grahame waited
for a reply, but the duke was in London, the means
and the mode of postal transmission were slow in
those days, and no answer came to his prayer.
</p>

<p>
Greumoch frequently terrified him by saying he
should be cut joint from joint and sent to London
in a hamper, packed in heather, like a haunch of
venison for the duke's table.
</p>

<p>
After being detained a considerable time, one day,
when hope of release was becoming more and more
faint, Killearn saw a boat pulled by eight sturdy
rowers in MacGregor tartan, the chief colours of
which are red, green, and black, coming down the
loch from Glengyle.
</p>

<p>
It reached the island, and a tall, armed
Highlander, in whom he recognized Rob Roy, leaped
ashore, and advanced towards the hut, followed by
several of his men.
</p>

<p>
Killearn, believing that his last hour had arrived,
and that they had come to execute him, drew forth
his breeches bible with trembling hands, and so
much did his tongue fail him that he could scarcely
reply to Rob's courteous but ironical salute.
</p>

<p>
"Killearn," said he, "I am come to set you at
liberty.  Montrose, your master, has proved as
treacherous to you as he has been to me.  Little
recks he whether I hang you on one of those trees,
or give you a swim in the loch with a stone at your
neck!  You are free; and this you must admit is
very different treatment to that which <i>I</i> should
experience if our circumstances were reversed, and
I were <i>your</i> prisoner, as now you are <i>mine</i>.  Return,
with this advice from me.  Collect no more the rents
of that land from whence I took you, as I mean to
be factor there myself in future."
</p>

<p>
"You, MacGregor?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;and what matter is there for wonder?  All
that country which Montrose and more than he
brink and boast as their own, is but a portion of the
heritage of Clan Alpine.  By false attainder and
studied legal villanies we have lost it; thus whatever
is possessed by the Grahames, the Murrays, and the
Drummonds is ours, and ours it shall be with the
help of God and our good claymores!"
</p>

<p>
He then restored to the bewildered Killearn all
his papers, receipts, and rental-book, and sent him
under an escort homeward through the pass of
Aberfoyle as far as the hills of Buchanan.
</p>

<p>
On this man, who had so greatly aided in his
ruin, and who had so grossly insulted his wife, he
thus "took no personal satisfaction," says a writer,
"which certainly shows the mildness of his character,
when we consider the habits and mode of thinking
of the Highlanders of his day."
</p>

<p>
In accordance with his threat he now proceeded
to summon the whole heritors and farmers of the
western district of Stirlingshire, to meet him in the
old church of Drymen, there to pay the black-mail
which for some time past they had neglected to send
to his nephew Glengyle.
</p>

<p>
On the appointed day he marched there with five
hundred men fully armed, and took possession of the
ancient church, which, as tradition avers, the Wizard
Napier (whose castle is close by) removed from
another place to its present site.
</p>

<p>
The land here belonged chiefly to the Grahames
of Montrose and Gartmore, yet such was the terror
of MacGregor's name, that all the farmers attended
and duly paid the usual tribute&mdash;all at least save
one, who was bold enough to decline compliance;
in consequence of which his lands were instantly
swept of everything that could be carried off, or
driven into the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Immediately on his return from London the Duke
of Montrose applied to the Scottish Commander-in-Chief,
Lieutenant-General Carpenter, for a sufficient
body of troops to repress, if not totally root out,
the MacGregors, who were now feasting in ease,
triumph, and jollity on the plunder of his estates, in
their fastnesses at the head of Loch Katrine.
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy gave a grand entertainment in the old
Highland fashion at Portnellan, and the joviality
was great, for the formerly poor and penniless
members of the clan he had enriched by the spoil of
their oppressors.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion deer and beeves were roasted
whole, and laid on hurdles or spars placed athwart
the trunks of trees, so arranged as to form a rustic
table, at which hundreds could seat themselves.  For
a hall they had the open valley, bordered by the
great mountains that look down on Glengyle,
canopied by the mists and clouds of heaven; in the
distance the blue water and the wooded isles
of Loch Katrine, all reddening in the setting
sun, and overshadowed by the vast summit of
Benvenue.
</p>

<p>
Alpine and other pipers played, nor were harpers
from the Western Isles wanting to make music
there, and plenteous libations of whisky (that never
paid duty to the king), of claret landed by French
smugglers, and of Helen's home-brewed ale went
round in stoups and quaichs and luggies.
</p>

<p>
There on Rob's right hand sat his aged mother,
with the little English boy, Harry Huske, upon her
knee, for the child was alternately the plaything
and pet of her and of her daughter-in-law, Helen
MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
After this great open-air banquet reels were
danced on the smooth turf, and torches of blazing
pine were tied to poles when the light of the long,
clear midsummer night began to fail.
</p>

<p>
But lo! a sudden gathering of dark clouds, and
the playing of green lightning about the summit of
Benvenue, announced a coming storm, warning all
to separate and seek shelter ere midnight came.
Many supposed the sudden storm which so rapidly
followed this entertainment was ominous of coming
evil; but a few hours after it was discovered to have
been the means, perhaps, of saving Rob Roy and
all his followers from death or capture.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br><br>
GREUMOCH TAKEN.
</h3>

<p>
On the evening of the rustic banquet, in compliance
with the request of the Duke of Montrose, three
bodies of troops were on their march, by three
different routes, to surprise the whole of the
MacGregors.
</p>

<p>
One party of the 15th Foot (then as we have said
called Harrison's Regiment) advanced from Glasgow;
another of the South British Fusiliers, under
Major Huske, came from Stirling, accompanied by
the ungrateful Grahame of Killearn as Sheriff
Depute of Dumbartonshire; and a third party
consisting of the Scots Royals (or 1st Regiment of the
Line) advanced from Finlarig.
</p>

<p>
But their marching was slow and devious, for the
country was strange, especially to the English
troops, none of whom could be quartered in Scotland
prior to the Union in 1707.  The Highlands were
then without roads, and the Government possessed
"no correct map of those unexplored regions
which," as a recent writer says, "were almost as
little known south of the Tweed&mdash;or we may rather
say, <i>south of the Tay</i>&mdash;as the African deserts, or
the interior of North America."
</p>

<p>
Hence, a night march among those pathless
mountains was an arduous task in these times; and
on this occasion the rain descended in blinding
torrents; the water-courses became white cascades;
mere runnels were swollen to streams, and streams
became dark impassable floods.  The guides led
the troops astray, either wilfully or by mischance;
so that all arrived too late at the passes, and ere
the storm was fairly over, Rob Roy (whom they
had hoped to pounce upon when in bed) had intelligence
of his unwelcome visitors, and got all his
men under arms.
</p>

<p>
Some firing took place about daybreak, and the
king's troops retreated, after the loss of only one
man, a grenadier, who was shot by Coll MacGregor
from the summit of a rock; but in retiring
the Scots Royals captured and carried off Rob's
right-hand man and long tried follower, poor
Greumoch MacGregor, who was immediately
transmitted to the Tolbooth of Creiff.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Feb. &mdash;, 1717, Gremoch Gregorach, airt and part with
Rob Roy <i>alias</i> MacGregor, in seizing of &mdash;&mdash; Grahame of
Killearn; robbing him, carrying him away, and detaining him a
prisoner several days.  A party ordered to be sent by Brigadier
Preston to guard him from Crieff Gaol to Edinburgh."&mdash;<i>Records
of the Tolbooth of Edinburgh</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Greumoch had been taken when lurking in the
clachan of Aberfoyle, a circle consisting of ten
large stones, a druidical temple, situated on rising
ground near the Parish manse.
</p>

<p>
On tidings reaching Edinburgh that this
important outlaw had been captured, Brigadier George
Preston, of Valleyfield, governor of the castle,
despatched a sergeant and six troopers of Campbell's
Dragoons (the Scots Greys) to Creiff, where they
received Greumoch, with strict orders to watch
him by day and night until delivered to the civil
authorities, and safely lodged in the heart of
Midlothian.  Being the first of Rob's men who had
fallen into their hands, and moreover being that
bold outlaw's chief follower and kinsman, it was
resolved by rope, by axe, and knife to make a
terrible example of him by a public execution&mdash;to
have him hanged, drawn, and quartered.
</p>

<p>
But in all these barbarities they were nearly
anticipated by the burghers of Crieff, who hated
the Celts for repeatedly burning their town, and
a mob followed the captive, shouting,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The wuddy&mdash;the wuddy! a tow&mdash;a tow!  let
him fynd the wecht o' himsel by the craig!" (which
meant in English&mdash;"The gallows&mdash;the gallows!  a
rope&mdash;a rope! let him feel the weight of himself
by the neck!")
</p>

<p>
So cried the Lowlanders, as Greumoch was conducted
by the troopers, not, as the mob expected,
to the fatal circle at the Gallow-hill, where the
Stewards of Strathearn held their courts of old,
but away on the road that led to the south.
</p>

<p>
Bound upon a horse, the sergeant marched his
prisoner through the long and lovely valley of the
Earn; with carbines loaded, a trooper rode on each
side of him, with orders to shoot him down if he
attempted to escape.
</p>

<p>
A village near Dunblane formed their first halting
place.  There one of the troopers, who seemed
less rough than his comrades, gave Greumoch a
dram, on which the sergeant said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come, Highlander, I'll teach you a toast.-"
</p>

<p>
"Will you?" asked Greumoch, sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;you dour-looking Redshank."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;my glass is full."
</p>

<p>
"Here's to the health of King George&mdash;and to
the confusion of his enemies, including Rob Roy,
the Pope, the Devil, and the Pretender!"
</p>

<p>
On hearing this offensive speech, Greumoch
dashed the glass and its fiery contents full into the
eyes of the sergeant and half-blinded him.
</p>

<p>
Inspired with rage, the non-commissioned officer
ordered his men to secure the prisoner beyond
all chance of escape during the night.  The
dragoons selected a heavy old-fashioned chair, in
which they placed Greumoch, and tied thereto his
hands, arms, and legs, lacing about him some
twenty yards of rope, the knots of which were tied
behind; and now, deeming him secure beyond all
hope of flight, they stabled their horses, threw off
their accoutrements, applied themselves to the
whisky-bottle, and after making very merry, retired
to rest in the outer room.
</p>

<p>
When all was dark and still, and poor Greumoch's
hands and limbs were fast becoming swollen,
benumbed, and stiff&mdash;all but powerless, in consequence
of the cruel manner in which the soldiers had
bound him&mdash;he remembered having seen a knife on
the table, where the sergeant had left it by chance.
</p>

<p>
Could he but reach that knife!  But, tied as he was,
of what use could it be?  Yet there occurred to him an
idea, which he resolved at once to put in practice.
</p>

<p>
By vigorous, yet almost noiseless, efforts with his
feet, he dragged the chair across the room towards
the table.  At last he reached it, and, after being
so frequently baffled that he was about to relinquish
the attempt in despair, he contrived to take up
the knife in his mouth, and to grasp the handle
firmly with his teeth.
</p>

<p>
Then, by turning his head on each side alternately,
he applied the edge so successfully to the
cords which crossed his shoulders, that he soon
severed them.  By this process he gradually got
one hand loose; but for many minutes it hung
powerless by his side.  However, anon he grasped
the knife with it, and in a short time was free;
but on rising from the chair, so much were his
limbs benumbed, that he staggered like a tipsy
man, and overturned both chair and table.  Heavily
they fell with a crash on the floor!
</p>

<p>
Greumoch rushed to the window, opened it, and
leaped into the dark and silent street of the village;
but at the same moment, from another window of the
house, two carbines flashed, and the balls whizzed
past as the troopers fired at him in their shirts.
</p>

<p>
"You are only dragoons," snouted Greumoch,
in Gaelic; "and dragoons never hit anything; so
fire away!"
</p>

<p>
Then with a derisive laugh he disappeared in the
darkness.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV.
<br><br>
ROB'S NARROW ESCAPE.
</h3>

<p>
The Duke of Montrose began to despair of ever
capturing Rob Roy or of conquering his men; but
he distributed among his tenantry a great number
of muskets, bayonets, and swords, with plenty of
ammunition, that they might be able to defend
themselves if attacked; but all these military stores
fell into the hands of the enemy, for Rob,
MacAleister, Greumoch, Coll, and other MacGregors,
by a systematic series of attacks or visits in the
night, disarmed all the tenants in succession; so
the duke gained nothing by the arrangement.
</p>

<p>
Another insurrection for the House of Stuart
was expected in the Highlands; and as the MacGregors,
by their conflicts, raids, and depredations,
had collected a great quantity of weapons, more
than were requisite for their personal equipment.
Rob Roy had all these carefully oiled, packed in
well-greased cowhides, and buried in secret places,
where perhaps many of them remain undiscovered
to this day.
</p>

<p>
The MacGregors daily became more daring, and
sometimes drove away the cattle from the parks,
beneath the very windows of Buchanan House,
where the duke resided.  The practice of "lifting,"
as it was termed, the cattle of a hostile clan was
then, and for many years after, common in the
Highlands; and as the feud between Rob and his
grace was of the most bitter nature, he carried the
system to the utmost extent.
</p>

<p>
The duke's rental was principally payable in
kind.  Thus Killearn had established large granaries
for storing up corn, meal, butter, cheese, &amp;c., at a
place called Moulin and elsewhere, which he deemed
secure.  Yet at all these storehouses Rob Roy
appeared regularly, when least expected, and
demanded supplies of grain, meal, or cheese for the
use of his family, his followers, or for the poor
people of the district, who were all devoted to him,
for he was deemed the friend and father, protector
and champion, of all who were necessitous,
unfortunate, or oppressed.
</p>

<p>
For the quantities thus taken he regularly gave
signed receipts, which stated that he took these
goods as a return in some part for the property of
which the duke had so unjustly deprived him;
and at times he frequently compelled the Montrose
tenantry to convey the goods thus appropriated
to his house at Portnellan, or wherever they were
required.
</p>

<p>
In his desperation, Montrose resolved to attempt
the capture of Rob in person, and applied to the
Privy Council for authority to raise a body of horse
and foot militia among his own dependants, supposing
probably that they would be better suited to
a warfare among the mountains than the troops of
the line.
</p>

<p>
It is said that the duke had such a dread of the
greater or more active enmity of Rob Roy that,
singularly enough, "<i>his name</i> was intentionally
omitted, and the act was expressed in general
terms, as being one to repress sorners, robbers,
and broken men&mdash;to raise the hue-and-cry after
them, to recover goods stolen by them, and to seize
their persons."
</p>

<p>
In consequence of the state of society which then
existed in the Highlands, where the people dwelt
in tribes or communities and in sequestered glens,
which were separated by great mountain ridges,
by pathless forests, while deep defiles or narrow
passes formed the only access to the country,
sudden raids and onslaughts, if vigorously conducted,
could be easily made, with great peril, however,
and with certain subsequent vengeance.
</p>

<p>
The two bodies of horse and foot now mustered
and armed by Montrose were composed of men
entirely devoted to him, and more or less
antagonistic to the MacGregors, at whose hands they
had all suffered severely.  They wore the duke's
livery&mdash;blue coats faced with red, with trews of
the Grahame tartan, and each wore in his bonnet
a laurel leaf.  There was not a man among them
but had something to revenge, in the shape of a
farm burned, a kinsman slain, or a herd carried
off; so the measures now put in force against him
compelled Rob Roy to be more than ever wary,
for although hitherto most fortunate in all his
achievements and escapes, he could not hope to
be always so.
</p>

<p>
Selecting a time when many of the MacGregors
were absent at distant fairs, on a dusky evening in
the November of 1717, it was resolved to beat up
Rob's quarters.
</p>

<p>
Assisted by a few of the horse grenadiers of
MacDougal (now a lieutenant-colonel), the duke's
militia, led by a gentleman named Colonel Grahame,
a brave and determined fellow, who had served
under Charles XII. in his war with Russia, passed
rapidly and unseen through the pass of Aberfoyle,
and about midnight reached the house and clachan
of Portnellan, at the head of Loch Katrine.
</p>

<p>
There was no moon, and all was dark and still;
not even a dog barked, when the house, which was
thatched with heather, was completely surrounded
on all sides by men with muskets loaded and
bayonets fixed.  The dragoons were led by the
only unwilling member of the expedition&mdash;Willie
Gemmil, now a sergeant.
</p>

<p>
The cottages wherein MacAleister, Greumoch,
and others dwelt, adjoined the house of Rob, and
formed a kind of small square, in the centre of
which was a patch of ground, cultivated as a kitchen
garden, and common to the whole community.
</p>

<p>
These cottages were built as such edifices are still
constructed in the Highlands.  The smoothed face
of a rock made the floor; several large boulders of
black whin formed the corners of the gables, and a
few courses of turf plastered with clay made up the
walls.  On the rough pine <i>cabers</i> of the roof
lay the thatch, composed of fern with its root
ends outwards, and tied with ropes of twisted
heather.
</p>

<p>
As these humble edifices burned like a heap of
straw, Colonel Grahame said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Fire all these thatched roofs at once, and smoke
the rascals out like foxes.  Then shoot down every
one who comes forth!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, colonel," said an old officer, a
quartermaster named James Stewart; "under favour,
sir, I will have no hand in such butcherly work.
Our orders are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To seize or destroy Rob Roy at all hazards!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but we have not King William's sign-manual
in our pockets to make another Glencoe
at the head of Loch Katrine," retorted the
quartermaster.
</p>

<p>
"Sirrah&mdash;do you dispute my orders?" began
the colonel, furiously, when Sergeant Gemmil
approached and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Please your honours, to fire the cottages would
rouse the whole country on us, as if the fiery cross
went through it; and we should all be cut to pieces,
horse and man, before we could escape by Aberfoyle,
or the pass of Loch Ard."
</p>

<p>
"Egad, you are right, sergeant; so let us beat
up this rogue's quarters more quietly," replied
Grahame.
</p>

<p>
Though the house was humble, being merely a
cottage with stone walls, the door was strong; but
it was soon dashed open by a musket butt; then all
shrunk back, with their bayonets at the charge,
expecting MacGregor, like a baited lion, to spring
forth upon them sword in hand, for all dreaded
the length and strength of his arm; but instead
there appeared only three women trembling in
their night-dresses.
</p>

<p>
One of these, an aged woman, was Rob's mother;
the others were Helen MacGregor and her foster-sister,
who, when she married, had come with her
from her father's house of Comar, which stood on
the eastern slope of Ben Lomond.
</p>

<p>
On Colonel Grahame imperiously demanding
"where Robert MacGregor Campbell was?" they
assured him that he and all his followers were
absent; and that if this was doubted, the house
might be searched.
</p>

<p>
"Absent&mdash;where?" said Grahame, biting his
long leather gauntlet with undisguised vexation.
</p>

<p>
Ere the ladies could speak, a scout or spy named
MacLaren&mdash;the same person whom Rob had met at
the inn of Chapelerroch&mdash;arrived, breathlessly, to
inform the colonel that on the preceding evening he
had seen MacGregor with a chosen party of his men
at a change-house, or wayside tavern, near
Crianlarich in Strathfillan.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure of this?" said the colonel, sternly
and suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Sure as that I now address you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"If this be true, you shall have ten guineas; but
woe to you, rascal, if you deceive us!  Sergeant
Gemmil, look to this fellow, and if he attempts to
give us the slip before we reach Strathfillan shoot
him down."
</p>

<p>
Leaving the farmhouse untouched, for to fire it
would have defeated the object in view, the colonel's
party, guided by the spy, proceeded up Glengyle,
from thence across the Braes of Balquhidder, and
just as day began to brighten the mountain peaks,
they found themselves at the lonely change-house
of Crianlarich, which stood in a sequestered and
pastoral part of Strathfillan.
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy, as the spy informed them, was then in
the house; but his men, to the number of twenty,
occupied a barn which adjoined it.  In that place
they feared no surprise, and kept no watch; thus,
Colonel Grahame, when he dismounted and approached
the barn, on peeping through one of the
air openings in the wall, saw the MacGregors lying
asleep on some bundles of straw, with their swords,
shields, and muskets beside them.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, fellow," said he to MacLaren, to
whom he gave at once the promised guineas.
"There are twenty rogues asleep here, and we shall
cut them off to a man; but the master thief must
be taken before we rouse his followers.  Then I shall
hang the keeper of this tavern, and burn it down,
without studying the scruples of our quartermaster,"
he added, with a dark frown at Mr. Stewart.
</p>

<p>
A dismounted trooper applied the heel of his
heavy jackboot to the door of the house, and with a
single kick made it fly open.
</p>

<p>
Softly though the troop had approached the
dwelling, by riding on the grass or heather, Rob
had heard them, and was up, clad, and armed, with
his target braced upon his left arm, at the moment
the door was broken open.
</p>

<p>
He put forth his bonnet upon the point of a stick,
and in the grey twilight of the morning twenty
muskets were discharged at it.  Then, before the
soldiers could reload, he sprang upon them with a
shout, and cut down two.  The noise of the volley
having brought all his men to their feet, they rushed
from the barn and assailed the Grahames in the
rear, driving them and the horse grenadiers pell-mell
round the house, and severely wounding several
of them.
</p>

<p>
"To the hills! to the hills! and follow me!"
shouted Rob, as he slung his shield on his back,
and dashed off at his utmost speed towards the
mountains.
</p>

<p>
Under a fire of muskets and carbines, he and his
men crossed unhurt a torrent that foamed through
the valley, and seeking a path, where few infantry
and certainly no cavalry could follow, they began a
leisurely retreat up the mountains towards the head
of Loch Lomond.
</p>

<p>
Exasperated by this sudden and unlooked-for
escape, Colonel Grahame ordered the horse to make
a detour, and the infantry to follow in direct
pursuit.
</p>

<p>
Then began a desultory skirmish, in which the
MacGregors had all the advantage; for their tartans
blended with the dun-coloured heather and green
ferns, while the militia were fatally conspicuous in
their blue uniforms.  Thus, several were shot, and
MacAleister threw the spy, MacLaren, into a mill-race,
near the House of Comar, where he was swept
away and drowned.
</p>

<p>
After this, "the Grahames thought proper to
withdraw," and thus ended another attempt to
capture Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
To avenge this defeat, and the capture of his
factor, it is related in the "Domestic Annals of
Scotland," that the Duke of Montrose got all his
farmers in the Lennox armed and mounted, for the
purpose of attacking Rob; but Glune-dhu, the
nephew of the latter, with the MacGregors of
Glengyle, attacked his grace's men, and surrounded and
disarmed them.  Of this encounter we are unable
to furnish the details; but, unfortunately for our
hero, the next attempt had a very different result.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br><br>
A WEIRD STORY.
</h3>

<p>
In tracing the history of Rob Roy, we now come to
one of those dark and supernatural events which,
according to Highland tradition, were then a
portion of the everyday life of the Scottish
mountaineers, and were the result of local influences,
and by their minds being deeply imbued in early
youth by poetry and music, by legends anterior
even to the songs of Ossian, and by the solemn
scenery of the vast solitudes which formed their
home.
</p>

<p>
The strange event referred to, occurred in the
Tower of Glengyle.  Another version of it has
been given by a celebrated essayist on the superstitions
of the Highlanders, but without stating the
locality, or who were the actors therein.
</p>

<p>
Some days after baffling Colonel Grahame's party
at Crianlarich&mdash;and while Montrose was planning a
raid, to be led by himself in person into the
mountains, for the purpose of capturing Rob Roy&mdash;the
latter, with MacAleister, was hunting in the old
Royal forest of Glenfinglas, and among the hills
that look down on Glenlochy, a long and narrow
vale in Breadalbane, where, in his father's time,
Duncan of the Heads resided, and where the ruins
of his house are still to be traced among the
heather.
</p>

<p>
Rob and his foster-brother had urged the sport
in the good old Highland fashion, for then the
clansman would pursue the antlered stag for days,
sleeping by night in his tartan plaid on the bleak
mountain side; or propped on the beetling rock,
with his long gaff, heedless alike of death or danger,
would catch the scaly salmon in the leap between
the sky and the foaming cascade; but, as a recent
author says, "nothing short of starvation would
make him take part in the brutal German battues
which now prevail in the Highlands."
</p>

<p>
When on hunting expeditions, Rob always gave
the salmon taken, the venison stalked, or the
capercailzie and ptarmigan shot by his long Spanish gun,
to the poor, or to the aged who were no longer
able to hunt for themselves; and often he shared
their huts, however humble; for north of the
Highland border Rob Roy was everywhere welcome
among the people.
</p>

<p>
The short autumn day was closing; the mountains
were growing dark; the eagle and hawk had
gone to their eyry in the rocks of Benvenue, though
the wild grey geese were still floating on the
bosom of Loch Voil, when Rob and MacAleister
took their way across the hills to return home; but
a storm came on as they descended Glengyle, so
instead of progressing towards Loch Katrine,
MacGregor repaired to the residence of his nephew,
who, in conformity to the oppressive laws passed
against the clan, was compelled to name himself
Gregor MacGregor <i>Grahame</i>, yet is better known
as Glune-dhu, and captain of the castle of Doune
under Prince Charles Edward.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the tower, Rob found that his
nephew, the laird, with all his followers, was
absent on a hunting-match with the Earl of
Breadalbane; but the old housekeeper and butler made
him welcome.  The two hunters had brought more
than enough with them to sup the whole household,
for Rob had two bunches of blackcock and curlew
at his sword-belt, and MacAleister carried a small
red deer slung over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
A blazing fire of bog-pine and fir-cones was made
in the arched fireplace of the old hall, and there the
hunters prepared to pass the night comfortably,
after the toil of their late hunting expedition.
</p>

<p>
Supper over, a jorum of hot whisky-toddy was
brewed in an antique punchbowl; the iron gates of
the tower were secured for the night; the old
servants retired to their beds, and Rob and
MacAleister sat by the ruddy hearth, talking of their
late wanderings, of tidings they expected to hear
from Seaforth about a rising in the Western Isles;
and without any intention of passing the remainder
of the night elsewhere than by that jovial fire, and
wrapped in their ample plaids.
</p>

<p>
Their late arduous wanderings in the keen cold
mountain air, with the warmth of the glowing fire
and the steaming punch, combined to make Rob
drowsy, and ere long he dozed off into a sound
sleep; but MacAleister, as he afterwards related,
felt in no way able to follow his leader's example,
though particularly anxious to do so.  He became
acutely wakeful, for a strange and unwonted
anxiety weighed upon his mind, and at times a
shudder passed over his frame&mdash;a <i>grue</i>, as the
Lowlanders term it&mdash;a supposed sign that an unseen
spirit hovers near you, or that some one is treading
on the ground which is to form your grave, however
far away that ground may be.
</p>

<p>
His eyes wandered over the old and faded family
portraits which adorned the hall; he sought to
shun them; but they seemed to exercise a strange
fascination over him, which compelled him to look
at them again and again, till they grew, to his alarm,
almost instinct with life.
</p>

<p>
There was Alaster of Glenstrae, who led the clan
to battle at Glenfruin, and who died on the gibbet
at Edinburgh, looking grimly out of his iron helmet.
There, too, was Colonel Donald MacGregor, in his
wig and breastplate, looking as fierce as when
he slew Duncan nan Cean, or carried terror
among the Westland Whigs when the Highland
host came down in the days of the Covenanters.
</p>

<p>
There were others in laced coats and tartan plaids,
but all armed to the teeth&mdash;worthies who had
departed this life with a foot of cold steel in their
bodies, leaving more quarrels and broadswords than
silver or gold behind them; and as he turned from
one pale face to another, while the candles burned
down and the fire waxed low on the hearth,
MacAleister began to feel how,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By dim lights seen, the portraits of the dead<br>
  Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread!<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Add to all this the wavering gleams of the fire, the
weird shadows they cast across the ancient hall, and
the solemn sough of the midnight wind without, as
it swept down Glengyle and moaned through the
machicolated battlements of the old tower, shaking
its grated windows, and waving too and fro the
russet-coloured tapestry that overhung the doorway,
driving out the brown moths to flutter about the
fading lights.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Rob Roy slept heavily.
</p>

<p>
By Highland superstition it had long been understood,
that when two persons were left thus, they
should either both sleep at the same time or keep
each other awake; for if one slept, the other was
left to the mercy of the spirits of the air.
</p>

<p>
MacAleister called to MacGregor, but received no
answer, and in the vaulted hall the hollow echoes of
his own voice affrighted even his bold spirit.  Then
as a sudden and heavy chill fell over his sturdy
frame, and a sickly and deadly fear stole into his
heart, he strove to rise and grasp his foster-brother,
but found himself frozen, riveted, chained, as it
were, to his seat by a power or will superior to
his own!
</p>

<p>
At that moment the arras which closed the lower
end of the hall, and which had been violently shaken
from time to time by the stormy gusts of wind, was
suddenly parted, and there entered two tall and
grim-looking gillies, in the Highland dress, and
fully armed, bearing lighted candles in antique
silver branches.
</p>

<p>
Other figures, misty, wavering, and indistinct,
appeared beyond; but in the gillies MacAleister, with
horror in his soul, recognized two MacGregors whom
he had seen slain in his boyhood, and whom he had
actually assisted to bury near the ruined church on
Inchcailloch.
</p>

<p>
Behind the bearers of the candles came a bearded
piper, with his pipe on his shoulder, the drones
decorated by long tartan streamers; the bag was
distended, and he fingered the notes of the chanter
rapidly, while his pale face seemed swollen by the
exertion of playing; but neither from the instrument
nor the tread of his feet came the slightest
sound, as he passed like a shadow slowly round the
hall, without looking on either side, though his
glazed eyes shone with a blue weird gleam in the
light of the fire; and then the henchman discovered,
by a peculiar mole and a wound on the right cheek,
that this was the phantom of Alpine's grandsire,
who played the clan to Glenfruin, and was said to
have been spirited away by the <i>Dosine Shie</i>, or
fairies.
</p>

<p>
Then followed many ladies and gentlemen of the
House of Glengyle, who had been in their graves
for years, with grey visages, wan, ghastly, and
solemn, and wearing costumes quaint in fashion and
long since obsolete, or to be seen only in such
portraits as those which hung around the hall.
</p>

<p>
Spellbound, incapable of motion, and while his
leader slept soundly, MacAleister saw all these
phantoms take seats at the table beside them; the
ladies spreading out and gracefully disposing the
ample flounces of their great tub-fardingales, as if
in life; the gentlemen adjusting the curls of their
cavalier locks, or great perukes; others shook out
the folds of their belted plaids, or ran their wan and
wasted fingers through their long wavy beards, as
they seemed to converse with each other, to assent
or dissent, and sometimes frown&mdash;conversed, but
without a sound, for the pinched blue features of
their long and awfully solemn faces moved spasmodically,
and their gestures varied, as if they talked,
but not a voice or a word reached the ear of the
terrified MacAleister.
</p>

<p>
At last one who closely resembled the portrait of
Alaster of Glenstrae, for his helmet was crested by
the entire wing of a golden eagle, and whose neck
was moreover distorted as if by strangulation (for
Glenstrae had been ignominiously hanged),
produced a pack of cards, and then all proceeded
to play.
</p>

<p>
The cards were scarcely dealt, when MacAleister
saw the figure of Oina&mdash;of his daughter&mdash;she who
had perished at Inversnaid, with her dark hair
dishevelled and floating about her shoulders, wearing
the very plaid in which her husband buried her,
hovering at the back of those unearthly visitors;
and with, deadly fear he perceived that she was
regarding him with a sad yet tender smile in her
black lack-lustre eyes.
</p>

<p>
It was remarkable that Oina's form was more
palpable than the rest, for some who had died ages
ago were transparent, so that he saw other objects
through them.
</p>

<p>
After a time the players relinquished the cards,
and some betook them to what the Highlanders
called <i>palmermore</i> (the tables), which requires three
on each side, who throw the dice alternately; but
though shaken violently, neither boxes nor dice
emitted the slightest sound.
</p>

<p>
Now a muffled figure glided to the side of Oina.
</p>

<p>
On her regards being again turned to her father,
this muffled figure threw off a wet and dripping
plaid, and lo!  MacLaren, the spy, whom he had
drowned in the millrace at Comar, stood before him,
with a malignant and demoniac grin on his cold and
damp visage.
</p>

<p>
He drew near and breathed on the face of MacAleister,
and so cold was that breath, so icy and
chill, that it seemed to freeze the marrow in his
bones.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a cock crew, and with a shriek
the spellbound man started to his feet, to find the
fire extinguished, the candles burned out in their
sockets, MacGregor still muffled in his plaid and
fast asleep in a chair beside him, while grey dawn
stole through the grated windows of the gloomy
castle hall.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br><br>
THE HAUNTED WELL.
</h3>

<p>
Rob Roy was instantly roused by MacAleister, who,
in an excess of terror, related the vision of the past
night, and begged that they might retire from
Glengyle at once, as his soul was filled with dismay.
</p>

<p>
Rob, though deeming the whole affair a dream,
as it was no doubt, felt somewhat disturbed by the
story; for MacAleister maintained that it was a
warning of his last hour being at hand; and still on
his pale, blanched face he seemed to feel the icy
breath of the phantom MacLaren.
</p>

<p>
Rob was too deeply imbued with the superstition
of his time and country not to feel unpleasantly
impressed by the whole affair, and fearing that
something might be wrong at Portnellan, or that his
presence there might be necessary, he and his
follower set forth at once from the tower of
Glengyle.
</p>

<p>
They proceeded quickly down the valley, passing
through a dense old wood, which had grown there
for ages.
</p>

<p>
In this wood was a clear and silvery fountain,
which flowed into a tributary of Loch Katrine, and
near it stood a little stone cross, covered with green
moss and grey lichens.  It had a great reputation
for sanctity, and though frequently removed and
cast elsewhere by the Presbyterians, by some means
it always found its way back to the well, which was
said to have been haunted of old by a beautiful
fairy, with long flowing golden hair and shining
garments&mdash;a water spirit like the Undine of the
German romance.
</p>

<p>
Seeking the old fountain, Rob took a long draught
of its pure cool stream, and drew aside a little way
while MacAleister took off his bonnet and proceeded
to say a prayer, for the adventure of the
past night pressed heavy on his heart: but he had
only uttered a single sentence, when he started back
in terror, exclaiming that the pale grey face of
MacLaren appeared under the water of the well, with
the old malignant smile on his lips and in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Your dreams have bewildered you, Callam,"
said Rob Roy; "take courage&mdash;anon you will
forget them."
</p>

<p>
But he had scarcely spoken, when there was a
shout that woke every echo in the wood, and
bursting through the trees and bushes about
twenty dismounted troopers fell upon them, sword
and carbine in hand.
</p>

<p>
MacGregor's claymore flashed from its sheath in
a moment; and opposing his shield to them, he was
about to break through and escape, when six levelled
their carbines, and Colonel Grahame called upon him
to "surrender, or he would be shot down without
mercy!"
</p>

<p>
"I know how to die, but not how to yield,"
replied MacGregor, proudly.
</p>

<p>
"Then die in your obstinacy!" exclaimed the
colonel; "fire!"
</p>

<p>
But the troopers paused, on which the faithful
MacAleister exclaimed to his foster-brother
in Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
"Let them fire at <i>me</i>, and when their guns are
empty do thou break through, thou who wert nursed
at my mother's breast&mdash;and God speed!"
</p>

<p>
With these words MacAleister threw himself,
sword in hand, upon the troopers, who fired their
carbines, and, pierced by four bullets, the devoted
foster-brother of Rob Roy fell dead on the grass!
</p>

<p>
The heart of the latter was wrung within him
on witnessing this sad catastrophe, and instead of
flinging himself with fury on the soldiers and
breaking away, as his foster-brother had expected, and
had exhorted him to do, he stood for a minute with
irresolution, gazing at the corpse, from which the
blood was yet welling, with rage and sadness on his
face and in his soul.
</p>

<p>
That minute of irresolution and grief lost all!
</p>

<p>
From every quarter of the wood, soldiers whom
the firing had summoned, came hurrying in, and
hemmed round on every side by swords, by levelled
bayonets, halberts, and clubbed carbines, Rob Roy
was beaten to the ground, and when well-nigh
senseless was disarmed and bound with strong
ropes, as if he had been a madman or a wild
animal.
</p>

<p>
Then, on being dragged to his feet, he found
himself the prisoner of the Duke of Montrose, who
surveyed him with a fierce and exulting expression
in his proud and haughty face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" exclaimed MacGregor, with a groan,
"oh, eternal infamy! a prisoner, and
Montrose&mdash;<i>to thee</i>!"

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br><br>
ROB ROY TAKEN.
</h3>

<p>
The duke wore a blue coat, faced and cuffed with
scarlet, richly braided on the breast with broad bars
of gold lace.  Save at the throat, it was unbuttoned,
and thus displayed a cuirass and gorget, both of the
finest steel, which he wore in lieu of a vest, and
over which fell the ends of his long cravat of
Mechlin lace.  He had on a three-cornered hat, a
flowing white periwig, and black jackboots with
gold spurs; and a sword and a brace of silver-mounted
pistols hung at his waistbelt.
</p>

<p>
By his side were Colonel Grahame, Quartermaster
Stewart, and others; for his grace had come hastily
into the mountains with three hundred men, to
reinforce the party from which Rob had escaped so
successfully at Crianlarich.
</p>

<p>
"At last, MacGregor Campbell," said the duke,
through his clenched teeth, while his eyes
sparkled with triumph and resentment; "AT LAST
you are in my power, and your doom hangs
upon my lips!"
</p>

<p>
MacGregor uttered a scornful laugh, and though
his hands were bound behind him, he drew his
sturdy figure proudly up to its full height and
measured the duke with a provoking glance of
profound disdain&mdash;viewing him deliberately from head
to foot.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my bold reiver, what have you to say?"
</p>

<p>
"For myself, my lord duke?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Montrose, fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Simply, that by fraud and force you have won
a poor victory over a single man.  <i>Use</i> that victory
as you please, Montrose, but <i>abuse</i> it not."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, I shall use it justly, as I am entitled
to do; for you know that you have long been a
doomed felon, on whose head a price has been set."
</p>

<p>
"By whom?" asked MacGregor, disdainfully.
</p>

<p>
"The king and government."
</p>

<p>
"A German usurper and Scottish traitors like
yourself!" replied the other furiously.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!&mdash;it matters not how you name them; you
are nevertheless a foredoomed felon, and as such
shall you die!"
</p>

<p>
"And who caused me to be stigmatized as such&mdash;who
but you?  Silence!  Duke of Montrose, and
lead me where you will; but be silent, I say.
Honour is like fine steel&mdash;breathe upon it and the
surface becomes stained.  Sorely have you striven to
stain the honour of Rob Roy; but you have striven
in vain; for Rob will be remembered among these
green mountains and in the hearts of the Gael&mdash;look
down, O Heaven, and bless them!&mdash;when you,
duke so venal and corrupt, will be remembered
only as the enemy and oppressor of him you would
destroy."
</p>

<p>
"Egad, I like your spirit, MacGregor!" said
Colonel Grahame, as he sheathed his sword with an
emphatic jerk.
</p>

<p>
"My spirit may break, Colonel Grahame, but
never shall it bend," replied Rob Roy; "I may have
my faults like other men, but if the best of us had
these written on his forehead, he would, as the saw
hath it, pull his bonnet well over his eyes.  Till
your chief made himself my enemy, I was a quiet, a
peaceful, and a God-fearing man; but he made
desolate my hearth and home; he seized my patrimony,
and cast me forth into the world a broken
man, an outlaw, and a beggar, with a price upon
my head, to be hunted like a wild beast by soldiers
and militia, horse and foot&mdash;I, a Highland gentleman,
whose lineage was equal, if not superior to his
own.  But as Fingal said to Swaran, 'The desert
is enough for me, with all its deer and echoing
woods!' so I took my target and claymore, and
retired to the steep mountain and the wild forest,
with my good wife and my little ones.  Since then,
all we have endured has been enough to summon
all the spirits of the Clan Alpine who have
suffered and died since the field of Glenfruin,
back from blessed heaven to the vengeance of
earth!"
</p>

<p>
"Let their spirits come," said the duke, with fierce
irony; "see if they will avail much, when you swing
by the neck in the Broad Wynd of Stirling, even as
Alaster of Glenstrae swung after his fine day's
work at Glenfruin."
</p>

<p>
"We are not yet in the Broad Wynd of Stirling,"
said Rob, confidently; "but set me free for five
minutes&mdash;put my broadsword in my hand, and
here, on this plot of grass, will I fight you face to
face and foot to foot&mdash;ay, with three of your best
men, if you choose."
</p>

<p>
"I do not fight with felons," replied Montrose,
loftily.
</p>

<p>
"Will you not meet me like a brave,&mdash;I cannot
call you an honest, man?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not fight with felons," was again the
cutting reply.
</p>

<p>
MacGregor crimsoned with passion, and exclaimed
hoarsely,&mdash;"Woe to you, dastard duke!  Alas, that
I should ever speak thus to one who bears the good
name that was borne by the Great Marquis, the
gallant Dundee!"
</p>

<p>
"Enough of this," said the duke, also becoming
red and husky with passion.  "To horse, gentlemen,
and away for Stirling.  Colonel Grahame,
bind the villain to one in whom you can place
implicit trust, and let him be well watched.  The
man who permits him to escape, I will pistol with
my own hand!"
</p>

<p>
MacGregor was secured to a horse behind a trooper,
whose waistbelt was passed through the belt from
which his sword and pistols were taken; his hands
were also tied behind, so that it was impossible for
him either to slip or leap off; and in this
ignominious fashion, escorted by nearly four hundred of
the duke's local militia, horse and foot, he was
carried away a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
As they departed from the Haunted Well, he
gazed sadly at the stiffened corpse of his faithful
friend and foster-brother, Callam, son of the
arrow-maker,&mdash;one who had never failed him in many an
hour of peril, and whose remains were left where he
fell, and where a cairn now marks his grave.
</p>

<p>
The captors had to travel with great secrecy, lest
the country people should rise to the rescue of Rob
Roy; but with all their speed the journey of twenty
miles towards the banks of the Forth occupied
the whole day, so rough and roadless was the
district through which they marched, down by
Glenfinglas and Bochastle, through the pass of
Leney and by the beautiful Braes of Callender;
and many a wistful glance their unfortunate prisoner
cast back to the mountains; for they looked down
on his secluded home, where his wife and children
dwelt, and where ere long they would be bewailing
him in hopeless sorrow.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br><br>
THE FORDS OF FREW.
</h3>

<p>
In his exultation at having personally made captive
a prisoner so important to the State, and for whose
seizure a reward had been so long offered, as a
rebel, traitor, outlaw, and robber, the Duke of
Montrose ordered his trumpets to play and his
kettledrummers to beat, when the smoke, the
steep ridge, the castled rock, and grey old walls of
Stirling appeared in the distance rising amid the
green and lovely valley of the Forth.
</p>

<p>
MacGregor gazed sullenly and fiercely at the
distant fortress, wherein, for a brief time, he would
be a prisoner, if he could not escape by the way.
</p>

<p>
They had now crossed Lanrick Mead and the
green Braes of Doune, and before them lay the
long snaky windings of the Forth, which the duke
ordered his troopers to pass by the Fords of
Frew&mdash;those deep and treacherous fords which Rob knew
so well that, as history tells us, and as already
related, he guided the army of Mar through them
after the battle of Sheriffmuir.
</p>

<p>
As they drew near the river, the duke, for the
greater security of his prisoner, ordered him to be
bound anew with a horse-girth to Quartermaster
James Stewart, one of the most powerful and
resolute of his followers, adding, as he saw the
buckle secured under his own eye,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And you shall keep him company thus until
we have him in the care of the captain of Stirling
Castle, or the goodman of the Tolbooth."
</p>

<p>
Stewart evinced some repugnance to this mode
of conducting the prisoner, for the latter and
he were old acquaintances, who had frequently
trafficked in cattle in more peaceful and happy
times.
</p>

<p>
Rob submitted in silence to this new arrangement;
again the brass trumpets sounded shrilly,
and the kettledrums rang, as the horse began
their march towards the fords; but Rob heeded
little this display of pride and triumph, for all
his thoughts were elsewhere,&mdash;at the fireside of
Portnellan, with his aged mother, his wife, and
children.
</p>

<p>
Again a prisoner!  Oh, how his brave heart
yearned for them, and trembled for their future, all
the more that now the faithful and unflinching
MacAleister was gone.
</p>

<p>
Coll was now a man, strong, brave, and active;
but had he sufficient skill or strategy to maintain
with success the desperate career which his father
might bequeath to him from the scaffold at
Stirling?
</p>

<p>
And then there were Duncan and Hamish, with
little Ronald, who was always in scrapes and
turmoils, and exhibited more scars and bruises
than even Greumoch, or the most veteran of
the clan, what might their fate&mdash;their future be?
</p>

<p>
Their ruddy sunburnt faces, their hearty boyish
voices, all came vividly to memory with the terrible
question,&mdash;How were their lives to end?
</p>

<p>
By a tender succession of links in his boys, he
had beheld a future life <i>beyond</i> his own; for by the
natural course of events they were to see what he
could never hope to see, or feel, or share in&mdash;the
coming time, which they were to enjoy (or endure)
when his strong hand was lying in the grave, when
his sword had returned to the anvil, and when on
earth he could avail them no more.  But what an
heritage of danger had he to bequeath them!
</p>

<p>
Then the future plans of the Jacobites (with
whose success he identified the restoration of his
people to their own name, and of his patrimony
to himself) came before him, for he was deeply
involved in their intrigues; and about the very time
of this most unexpected capture he was to have
met a messenger from the Marquis of Seaforth, as
that noble was styled by the loyalists in Scotland&mdash;a
messenger who was to precede an invasion of the
Highlands from Spain.
</p>

<p>
Twilight stole over the scenery.  The eagle had
gone to its eyry in the rocks; the lazy cormorant
and the long-legged heron had forsaken the shore,
and all was silent, or nearly so, for no sound broke
the stillness now, save the tramp of the horses, or
at times a loud shriek that rung upon the wind, and
wailed away in the distance.
</p>

<p>
It was the melancholy cry of the night-owl.
</p>

<p>
Darkness had set in when the leading files of the
duke's column began with great deliberation and
care to cross the Forth at Frew.  Recent rains had
swollen the river, which made a brawling sound
at the fords, though it usually rolls silently and
even somewhat sluggishly through its lovely valley,
a winding course of ninety miles towards the sea.
</p>

<p>
While the centre and rear of the horsemen were
halted by the margin of the river, the others crossed,
half-fording and half-swimming, and thereafter
scrambling up the rugged bank on the opposite
side, Rob Roy began to converse in low tones with
the quartermaster, James Stewart.
</p>

<p>
The grandson of the latter was some years ago
an innkeeper at Loch Katrine, and a guide to
tourists; and it was to his relation of this
adventure that Sir Walter Scott was indebted for one of
the most stirring passages in his novel, wherein,
however, he designates the trooper to whom Rob
was bound "Evan of the Brigglands."
</p>

<p>
Taking advantage of the darkness, the splashing,
the shouting, and noise as the troopers crossed
cautiously by two at a time, Rob implored Stewart,
"by all the ties of old acquaintance, of common
humanity, and good neighbourhood, to give him
some chance of escape from an assured doom&mdash;a
death of ignominy."
</p>

<p>
For some time Stewart heard him unmoved, till
MacGregor began to remind him that a day of
terrible vengeance would assuredly come anon, as
he would leave to his sons and followers the task of
destroying all who were in any way accessory to his
capture and execution.
</p>

<p>
Stewart knew too well what the MacGregors
were capable of attempting and performing, to hear
this without alarm, or to consider it an empty
threat; and to some emotions of compassion for
Rob as an old friend, and a sorely wronged and
oppressed man, were now added those of fear for
himself and his possessions.
</p>

<p>
He made no reply; but when the voice of the
duke was heard, as he called from the opposite
bank to bring over the prisoner, the quartermaster
guided his horse down the bank, and entered the
dark stream, which, with a loud rushing sound, was
flowing rapidly past.
</p>

<p>
Overhead the stars shone clearly and coldly, yet
the river and its wooded banks were involved in
gloom and obscurity; and when in the middle of
the stream, the quartermaster reined in his horse,
as if uncertain of its footing.
</p>

<p>
At that moment MacGregor felt the girth which
secured them together relaxed, as the buckle was
parted, and the cord which bound his wrists was
cut, by the friendly hand of Stewart.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," he whispered, as he pressed the
latter's hand; "you will never repent the deed
of to-night&mdash;never, if you live for a thousand
years!"
</p>

<p>
Slipping over the crupper of the horse, he dived
into the river, and swam under its surface for some
yards, till he could emerge with safety under the
shade of a clump of willows, where he crept ashore,
quietly and unseen, exactly as described in the
splendid novel which bears his name.
</p>

<p>
On Stewart ascending the opposite bank, where
the horsemen were getting into their ranks, and
forming in order under Colonel Grahame, the duke
instantly missed Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
"Villain!" he exclaimed, "where is your prisoner?"
</p>

<p>
Stewart began to falter out something by way of
explanation or excuse, when the duke, blind with
rage and fury, drew a long horse-pistol from his
holsters, and dealt him a blow on the head with
the steel butt&mdash;a blow from the effects of which
his descendant (the innkeeper) said he never
recovered.
</p>

<p>
Carbines were now discharged up and down the
stream, flashing in the darkness and waking the
echoes of the rocks.  A close search was made on
both banks by troopers on horse and foot, but
vainly, till day broke, for no trace could be
discerned of the fugitive, who knew the country
better than his pursuers, and by that time had
reached in safety the hill of Vaigh-mhor, amid the
rocks of which is a secret cavern, the haunt of
outlaws and robbers so lately as 1750.
</p>

<p>
There he lurked in safety until nightfall, after
which he proceeded with all speed back to the
banks of Loch Katrine, and reached his household
at Portnellan, where his family were in despair,
and where Greumoch, his future henchman, was
arraying five hundred men, for the purpose of
falling down into Stirlingshire to rescue or revenge
him.
</p>

<p>
But now a messenger arrived who warned them
that their swords were required for another
purpose, a third rising in the Highlands for King
James VIII., as he was named by the Scottish
cavaliers.

<h3>
CHAPTER XL.
<br><br>
SEAFORTH'S MESSENGER.
</h3>

<p>
The preceding chapters of our story will in some
degree have illustrated to the reader the peculiar
character, habits, and manner of the Scottish
Highlanders, and have shown how different they
were in many respects from their Lowland
countrymen.
</p>

<p>
"The ideas and employments which their
seclusion from the world rendered habitual," says
General Stewart of Garth, "the familiar contemplation
of the most sublime objects of nature&mdash;the
habit of concentrating their affections within the
narrow precincts of their own glens, or the limited
circle of their own kinsmen&mdash;and the necessity of
union and self-dependence in all difficulties and
dangers, combined to form a peculiar and original
character.  A certain romantic sentiment, the
offspring of deep and cherished feeling, strong
attachment to country and kindred, and a consequent
disdain of submission to strangers, formed the
character of independence; while an habitual
contempt of danger was nourished by their solitary
musings, of which the honour of their clan, and a
long descent from brave and warlike ancestors,
formed the theme.
</p>

<p>
"Thus their exercises, their amusements, their
mode of subsistence, their motives of action, their
prejudices and their superstitions became
characteristic, permanent, and peculiar.  Firmness and
decision, fertility in resources, ardour in friendship,
and a generous enthusiasm were the result of such
modes of life and such habits of thought.  Feeling
themselves separated by nature from the rest of
mankind, and distinguished by their language, their
habits, their manners, and their dress, they
considered themselves the original possessors of the
country, and regarded the Saxons of the Lowlands
as strangers and intruders."
</p>

<p>
But to resume:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The messenger who reached Portnellan was no
other than Sir James Livingstone, whom Rob had
encountered after the devastation of Kippen, and
who had now changed sides and become a Jacobite
in sheer disgust of the atrocities of the Ministry
after the battle of Sheriffmuir.
</p>

<p>
From Seaforth, chief of the MacKenzies, he bore
a letter to Rob Roy, stating that he intended to
rise in arms for the king, and desired the aid and
assistance of the Clan Alpine, when and where the
bearer would inform him, as it was dangerous to
commit his plans to paper.
</p>

<p>
The writer was William MacKenzie, Earl of Seaforth,
whose father had been created a marquis by
the exiled king.
</p>

<p>
"So, MacGregor, I have come at a fortunate
time," said Sir James, as they walked in conference
together by the shore of Loch Katrine; "your men
I see are all in arms&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And prepared to do all that men can do,"
replied Rob; "but the Lowlands are full of troops,
close up to the Highland border; now ships of war
come at times even into the salt lochs of the
Campbells, and so the Highlands are scarcely what they
were when we were boys, Sir James."
</p>

<p>
"True; but one good battle may alter all that;
and remember, Rob, that the Grampians are still
the <i>Dorsum Britanniae</i>."
</p>

<p>
"The what?" said MacGregor, with perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"The Backbone of Britain, as they were called of
old by a Scottish Kuldee."
</p>

<p>
"Seaforth refers me to you for information;
where is he now?"
</p>

<p>
"At Madrid."
</p>

<p>
"Madrid&mdash;oich; that is a long way from the
Braes of Balquhidder!" said Rob, with fresh
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"At Madrid," repeated Livingstone, "where his
Majesty James VIII. has been received with all the
honours due to the King of Great Britain by Philip
V., who is too good a monarch not to remember
the claim of King James to our throne&mdash;a claim
derived from Scripture, which says, 'The right of
the first-born is his.'"
</p>

<p>
"But what help does the Spanish king offer the
Blue Bonnets if they rise in arms?"
</p>

<p>
"Six thousand Spanish soldiers of the line, with
twelve thousand stands of arms, are to be embarked
on board of ten ships of war, under the command of
the Irish Duke of Ormond."
</p>

<p>
"A brave man!" exclaimed Rob; "but where
are these ships and Spaniards?"
</p>

<p>
"At San Sebastian and elsewhere.  This armament
will sail in the early part of next year for the
Western Isles, and will probably arrive while yet
the Highland passes are blocked up by snow.
Seaforth doubts not that you will join him, and if
possible make short work with the Munroes, the
Rosses, and other Whig clans, who will be sure to
break into Kintail on the first tidings that the
Spanish keels have passed through the Sound of
Slate.  With these Spanish soldiers, and with these
twelve thousand stands of arms, when distributed
among the loyal clans, and with the aid expected
from the Welsh and Irish, we may well hope, Rob,
to crush both the English and the Lowlanders; and
by this day twelvemonth we may see every head
wearing its own bonnet, and the elector at home in
Hernhausen."
</p>

<p>
All this sounded very well to Rob, who seldom
required a great incentive to attempt anything
desperate, especially against Highland Whigs, such
as the Rosses, Munroes, or Grants; so he pledged
himself "to meet the Marquis of Seaforth in Kintail
in the spring of the following year, with at least
four hundred good claymores;" and after spending
a few days at Portnellan, Sir James Livingstone
departed to visit some other Jacobite gentlemen,
and seek their aid.
</p>

<p>
The Highland winter had now set in with its
usual severity; the snow, which drifted deep in the
passes, rendered Rob safe from all attacks at that
time; so the days were occupied peacefully by his
people in attending to their cattle, hunting deer,
and collecting fuel; the evenings were spent with
the harp and pipe, with sword play, or practice
with the target and claymore, in dancing and
athletic exercises; till the spring days came, and
the ice began to melt in the deep lochs, and the
snow to dissolve in runnels of water down the steep
slopes of the mountains.
</p>

<p>
"The three Faoilteach have been as bad as the
worst days of winter," said Rob, as he looked over
the vast extent of hill and glen that lay round his
home; "so, please God, we shall have fair spring
weather, Helen, to meet Lord Seaforth in Kintail
na Bogh."
</p>

<p>
It is a belief in the Highlands that if the
<i>faoilteach</i>, three days which January borrowed from
February by the bribe of three young lambs, prove
fair and pleasant, there will be bad and stormy
weather throughout the ensuing year.
</p>

<p>
"I would you were safely back from Kintail,"
said Helen; "for danger, it may be death, are
before you, Rob.  Does not Paul Crubach say that
he has had visions of grey warriors riding along the
steepest cliffs of Craigrostan and Benvenue, where
mortal horseman never rode, nor living horse could
keep its footing?"
</p>

<p>
"Likely enough, good wife; for poor Paul
sees that which others never see," said Rob,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
And now on the 1st day of April, 1719, came a
messenger from Sir James Livingstone, to state
that the Spanish fleet had sailed for the Hebrides,
and directing Rob to march for Glensheil with all
the loyal and discontented Highlanders he could
collect, and to halt near the head of Loch Hourn,
till the Spaniards arrived.
</p>

<p>
"These Spaniards come from a land of wine
and oranges," said Helen; "how will our long
kail and oat cakes agree with their dainty
stomachs?"
</p>

<p>
"Better than English bullets, Helen," said Rob.
</p>

<p>
When he departed with his followers from
Portnellan he took with him the little English boy,
Harry Huske, for he doubted not that after falling
down into the Lowlands, or even before that time
came to pass, there would be many encounters
with the Government troops, and an opportunity
must occur for restoring him to his father the
major.
</p>

<p>
Helen MacGregor had become deeply attached to
the child, who had many pretty and winning ways;
thus she wept bitterly when he was taken from her,
and is said to have repeated the ominous words of
her former prediction, "that the boy was too fair
and beautiful to find a place on earth."
</p>

<p>
Secretly though the messengers of Livingstone
were despatched, the Government were on the alert,
and had their troops in the field nearly as soon as
the Jacobites, for so great was the terror in England
of this Spanish invasion, that aid was sought as
usual from Holland; and already six thousand
Dutch infantry, with a great body of British troops,
were on the march for Scotland.
</p>

<p>
At that period, the fighting force of the Highlands
consisted of at least fifty thousand men; but
so divided were the clans among themselves, that
seldom more than five thousand men at a time
came forth in any of the insurrections for the House
of Stuart.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLI.
<br><br>
ROB'S MARCH TO GLENSHEIL.
</h3>

<p>
On this occasion Rob Roy had four hundred men
with him, having left the rest at home under Coll
and Red Alaster MacGregor, with orders to keep
the pass of Loch Ard against any soldiers whom
General Carpenter might send by that route to
plunder or destroy.
</p>

<p>
It was on a lovely day in April when the
MacGregors, after a march of more than eighty miles
north-west across the mountains from Loch Katrine,
guided by a wandering harper named Gillian Ross,
from the Isle of the Pigmies, after skirting the
vast waste of the braes of Rannoch and the hills of
Glenorchy&mdash;by ascending the Devil's Staircase, and
from thence, passing by the base of the snow-clad
Ben Nevis, whose summit was hidden in masses of
grey vapour, by Corpach (or the vale of the corpses),
by Glen Arkaig and the head of Loch Hourn,
halted on the hills of Glensheil, in sight of the dim
and distant peaks of the Isle of Skye, and the
waves of the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
Along the base of the dark mountains which
there start abruptly, like masses of blue rock, from
the deep salt lochs of the west, wreaths of grey
smoke were curling on the wind.  These were from
the fires of the busy burners of kelp&mdash;a manufacture
the abolition of which, by the Parliament of 1823,
brought ruin and famine upon the poor peasantry
of Argyle and Ross.
</p>

<p>
The weather was mild and warm, though tempered
by the breeze from the ocean.  The MacGregors
encamped on the sheltered side of a mountain
slope; a stray cow or so, and the deer of the glens,
supplied them with food, which they cooked in the
old Scottish fashion, by boiling the flesh in its own
skin, or broiling it in fires formed of roots from a
morass, or dry branches from the nearest forest.
</p>

<p>
Every man carried his own oatmeal and
hunting-bottle of usquebaugh; and other incumbrance
or baggage they had none, save their arms and
ammunition.
</p>

<p>
Little Harry Huske had become hardy now, and
slept as snugly in the neuk of Rob's or Greumoch's
plaid, as when at home in Portnellan, though he
sometimes wept for his mother, as he had learned
to call Helen MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
The third day had been passed on the mountains
thus, when a gentleman in tartan trews, with
a laced coat and periwig, was seen approaching
the camp, mounted on a strong Highland
garron.
</p>

<p>
He and his followers (he had four armed men with
him, clad in Highland dresses of the MacKenzie
tartan) wore in their bonnets the white cockade, the
forbidden badge of the House of Stuart; consequently
they were received with acclamations by
the MacGregors, though one of the visitors was no
other than the redoubtable Duncan nan Creagh, now
somewhat bent and older than when we first
introduced him to the reader, but active, fierce, and
resolute as ever.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion he acted as guide to Sir James
Livingstone, the mounted man in trews.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, Sir James," said Rob Roy; "I trust
you bring us good tidings of the king and his
adherents."
</p>

<p>
"Would to heaven I could do so," replied the
baronet, with unconcealed dejection.
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked the other, with alarm.
</p>

<p>
"The fleet, with all the Spanish troops and
munitions of war, set sail from San Sebastian for
Scotland; but Heaven itself seems against this most
unlucky House of Stuart."
</p>

<p>
"Sir James Livingstone!"
</p>

<p>
"It is so; for Fortune and the elements are
alike their enemies!" exclaimed the other, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Speak quickly, Sir James," said MacGregor,
stamping his foot on the heather; "I am in no
mode either for parables or riddles, after marching
all this distance, and leaving my family and my
country all but open to the enemy; and I know
the tricks that Montrose and Killearn are capable
of playing me.  The fleet, you say, has sailed?"
</p>

<p>
"But encountered a dreadful gale off Cape Finisterre&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know not where that may be."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a headland off the coast of Brittany&mdash;where,
it matters not; but the storm lasted two
entire days, and drove the armament back,
dismasted and battered, to the Spanish coast, thus
disconcerting all the plans of the Duke of Ormond
and the friendly schemes of Philip V."
</p>

<p>
"Then we have marched here in vain!"
</p>

<p>
Sir James nodded his head sadly in assent.
</p>

<p>
"Has not a single vessel reached the Western Isles?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; two frigates&mdash;only two&mdash;under the
Spanish flag are now anchored at Stornoway, in
the Lewis, where they have landed the Marquis of
Tullybardine&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tullybardine!" repeated Rob, with knitted
brow.  "I remember him, a fair-haired youth, at
the castle of Blair, when his father, Duke John of
Athole, laid a black snare for me."
</p>

<p>
"Think not of that now, MacGregor," said
Livingstone, earnestly; "he is young and brave,
and steadfast to our king."
</p>

<p>
"Who more?"
</p>

<p>
"The Lords Seaforth and Marischal, with some
arms."
</p>

<p>
"How many?"
</p>

<p>
"Two thousand stands of muskets, and five
thousand pistols.  And there are three hundred
Spanish soldiers."
</p>

<p>
"Any money?" asked Rob, quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, some treasure in care of Don JosÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© de
Santarem, a Knight of Malta."
</p>

<p>
"Dioul!" said Rob, waving his bonnet; "matters
are not so bad after all.  We are in for it now, and
must play out the game.  We cannot disperse without
fighting somebody, were it but to save from
distress the strangers who have come so far to serve
our exiled king."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," added Sir James, bitterly; "and
we have to save our own necks from the gallows."
</p>

<p>
"Are we to seize birlinns, and cross to the Lewis?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  In a few days Seaforth will unfurl the
Caberfeidh,* and come hither with all his men;
and to you his wishes are, that you shall keep the
pass of Strachells against all who approach it from
the east or south until he arrives in Glensheil.  The
Rosses and Munroes are already in arms for the
elector."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A famous banner of the MacKenzies.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Let us cut the traitors to pieces," said Rob,
"and then the loyal and the timid alike will join us
from all quarters."
</p>

<p>
In obedience to his instructions, Rob marched to
the narrow pass which is in the highest part of the
district of Glensheil, or <i>sheilig</i> (the Vale of Hunting),
that lies between the great forests of Seaforth and
Glengarry; but so long were the delays that the
snow had disappeared from the loftiest mountains,
and the swallow and cuckoo had come to the woods
of evergreen pine and feathery birch, ere the Spanish
soldiers with the MacKenzies and the wild MacRaes
reached the camp of the MacGregors.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Stornoway, in the Isle of Lewis, they
crossed to the mainland, and fortifying the mouth
of Loch Duich, took possession of Eilan Donan,
a castle of the MacKenzies, and placed cannon
on it.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, General Joseph Wightman, an active
and resolute officer, was pushing on through the
mountains from Inverness with a mixed force,
consisting of several companies of the 11th, 14th, and
15th Regiments (then known respectively as
Montague's Devonshire, Clayton's Bedfordshire, and
Harrison's Yorkshire), and two thousand Dutch
auxiliaries, with whom also came the Rosses, the
Munroes, and other clans who adhered to the House
of Guelph.
</p>

<p>
Huske was the brigade-major.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLII.
<br><br>
A STRANGE MEETING.
</h3>

<p>
Marching with all speed by paths that were wild
and rugged, the old Fingalian war-paths, or tracks
by which the cattle were driven, on the 9th of June
the troops of General Wightman came within ten
miles of the camp of Seaforth, when a halt was
ordered just as the sun was setting amid that solemn
scenery, where a deep and secluded arm of the sea
penetrates among the hills of Glensheil.
</p>

<p>
"Major Huske," said General Wightman, as the
wearied troops piled their arms, posted sentinels,
and prepared to cook some venison which had been
shot for them by the Munroes of Culcairn, "with an
officer and a hundred men of Montague's as an
advanced guard, or rather as an outlying picket,
you will march one mile further on, and see them
properly posted.  Reconnoitre well before you halt,
and if aught can be seen of the enemy send back a
messenger to me."
</p>

<p>
"For further instructions?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Look well about you; for the notorious
and desperate outlaw, Robert MacGregor, or Campbell,
who has been in arms against the Government
ever since the Revolution, is among these rebels,
and may give us more trouble with twelve men than
Lord Seaforth could with so many hundreds."
</p>

<p>
"Rob Roy!" exclaimed Huske, starting.
</p>

<p>
"Egad, yes; Rob himself," said the general,
dismounting.  "You seem surprised, major.  Did
he give you so great a fright when he beat up
your quarters at Inversnaid?"
</p>

<p>
"Do not mistake me, General Wightman,"
replied Huske, with an air of severity.  "It was
but the start of an almost savage joy which I
experienced, on hearing that I was to have again
opposed to me the man to whom I owe the infliction
of a terrible grief&mdash;the loss of my son Harry, my
poor little motherless boy!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, your son&mdash;yes," said the general, in an
altered voice; "I heard that he perished
unhappily&mdash;in the daring night attack on Inversnaid."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and I would rather that he had perished
when his mother did at Landau, than in the
hands of those half-naked Highland savages."
</p>

<p>
"Landau!  Zounds, major, I remember that
unfortunate affair too, for my tent was near yours,
on the left of the lines.  You remember our brigade
was posted near the river Zurich?"
</p>

<p>
"But if I am spared to meet these MacGregors
again I may teach this Rob Roy to feel something
of the torture I now feel; for two of his sons,
I have been told, are among his followers, and if
one of them fall into my hands again&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, do as you please, major, with Rob Roy
and his sons; but beware of ambuscades like that
into which he lured Clifford and poor Dorrington,
at Aberfoyle.  And now move to the front,
if you please.  Keep the picket under arms, and
throw out a line of double sentinels towards the
pass in the mountains."
</p>

<p>
In obedience to this order Major Huske marched
a hundred men of Montague's Regiment to the
distance of one mile from the main body, and
halting them among some wild whins for
concealment, with orders to remain accoutred, threw
forward a chain of sentinels, whom he posted in
person, in such places as he thought they could
best observe the approach of the enemy, and
communicate with each other, or with the picket
in their rear.
</p>

<p>
After this, as the night was clear and beautiful,
he walked a little way beyond them, to reconnoitre
and observe the country.
</p>

<p>
The scenery was wild in the extreme.  On one
side of a narrow inlet rose a tall cliff, where the
black iolar built his nest; at its base lay the still
water of the sea, where, in moonshine and sunshine
alike, the round black heads of the sea-dogs (whom
the Celts supposed to be fairies) were visible, as
they swam to and fro, fixing their dark and melancholy
eyes on the twinkling stars or the passing
boats.
</p>

<p>
On the other side of the inlet rose an ancient
barrow or burial mound, from which, as the
peasantry averred, strange gleams of lustre came at
night, with sweet melodious sounds.
</p>

<p>
The place was said to be enchanted, for any
person who sat thereon and spoke aloud heard
whatever they said repeated thrice.  Then it was
the fairies or the devil who replied; now it is only
the echo&mdash;the son of the lonely rock.
</p>

<p>
Huske was now nearly half a mile from his
sentinels; but in the clear summer twilight he
could see their figures distinctly, with their dark
grey coats and white leggings; and then he thought
of returning, when an armed Highlander, who had
been crouching among the heather, rose up
suddenly as an apparition, to bar his way.
</p>

<p>
His round shield was braced upon his left arm,
and his drawn claymore was glittering in his right
hand.
</p>

<p>
Major Huske laid his hand on his sword, and
stepping forward a pace or two resolutely, found
himself face to face with&mdash;ROB ROY!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap43"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIII.
<br><br>
MAJOR HUSKE'S REVENGE.
</h3>

<p>
For a moment Rob, who had been scouting or
reconnoitring in person by the Earl of Seaforth's
request, surveyed the major with evident doubt and
irresolution expressed in his sunburnt face, for this
was the hour when, as the Celts suppose, the spirits
of evil are abroad, and when wraiths and demons of
the air may assume the forms of human beings at
will; while, on the other hand, Huske, to whom no
such absurd idea occurred, and who had just reason
to respect and fear Rob's personal strength, thrust
his cocked-hat firmly upon his head, and surveyed
his foe, with fury and hatred sparkling in his
sombre eyes.
</p>

<p>
"So, villain!" he exclaimed, "we are fated to
meet again!"
</p>

<p>
"Beware how we part, if this is to be the style of
our conversation!" replied MacGregor, sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Fellow, are you so ignorant, or so stupid, as to
be unaware that by uttering a shout or firing this
pistol I can have you surrounded, and hanged or
shot, in three minutes?"
</p>

<p>
"Then, beware, Major Huske, how you fire the
shot or utter the shout; for ere you finished either,
my father's sword would clatter in your breast-bone,"
replied the other, quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Defend yourself, then, traitor though you be!"
said Huske, drawing a pistol from his girdle and
cocking it.
</p>

<p>
"I am no traitor," retorted MacGregor, proudly,
"for I never owned as king the German prince you
serve, but am the liegeman of James VIII., whose
enemies may God confound!  Moreover, I have no
wish to encounter you again, Major Huske&mdash;at
least, until this child, which has been long my
peculiar care, is in a place of safety."  As he spoke
he pointed to a boy, who was no other than little
Harry, the child taken at Inversnaid, and who was
sound asleep on the soft heather, with Rob's tartan
plaid wrapped round him.
</p>

<p>
"Right," said Huske, hoarsely; "my time for
retribution has come; this child shall go before the
Highland dog his father!"
</p>

<p>
Levelling his pistol in an instant, and before
MacGregor could interpose, the major shot the
sleeping child through the body.  There was a
convulsive gasp, a shudder under the tartan plaid,
and all was over!  "Unfortunate wretch&mdash;oh,
mistaken coward!" exclaimed Rob Roy, in a piercing
voice.  "Major Huske, by Heaven and St. Mary,
you have destroyed your own son!"
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;how?" cried Huske, wildly; for the
solemn and excited manner of MacGregor impressed
him with a terrible conviction of truth;
"my son, say you&mdash;my son?"
</p>

<p>
"I have spoken but too truly," said the Highlander,
while, heedless of what Huske might do with
sword or pistol, he knelt, with a sob in his throat,
and unfolding the bloody plaid, showed to the
horror-stricken officer the dead body of a little
golden-haired boy, whose features he could not fail
to recognize.
</p>

<p>
He covered his face with his hands, exclaiming&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, MacGregor, what dreadful deed is this I
have done?"
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause, and then Rob said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My people found your son asleep in his little
bed at Inversnaid, and carefully preserved him
until such time as he could be restored to you, his
father, or friends.  Hunted and proscribed as we
are, treated by such as you like wolves or other
wild beasts, a hundred difficulties were in the way
of having the child thus restored; and the poor
little fellow learned to love us, to be the playmate
of my children, the sharer of our humble hearth and
frugal board, while my good and gentle wife, who
knew that the boy was motherless, nurtured him
tenderly.  Being certain that you would be with
the army sent against Seaforth and the Spaniards,
I brought hither the child that we might restore
him, in the hope that for the good deed we had
done you might allow, as we say in Scotland,
bygones between us to be bygones; but, alas! this
is the restoration that Helen's heart foreboded!"
</p>

<p>
"How, Macgregor?"
</p>

<p>
"When she predicted so often that the child was
too sweet in temper and too fair in form to find a
place on earth; and now, woe worth the hour! he
has been sent by his father's hand to Heaven, from
whence he came!"
</p>

<p>
When MacGregor ceased, Huske had cast himself
on his knees among the heather, cowering down, in
wretchedness, with his face buried in his hands, and
sobbing heavily; while the former covered up the
little body, tenderly and gently, in his plaid, lest
the sight of its blood should too much shock the
murderer.
</p>

<p>
"Go, Major Huske,&mdash;return to your men," said
he, laying a hand kindly on the shoulder of the
officer; "my hand can never inflict on you a deeper
wound than your own has done.  From my soul I
pity you!  When seeking to wrong me&mdash;wrong me
cruelly and foully&mdash;you have destroyed your fair
little boy, whom I was learning to love as if he had
been my own; but," added Rob, taking off his
bonnet and pointing upward, "his pure spirit is
among the flowers that the angels will gather at the
foot of His throne who is above us."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, MacGregor," groaned Huske, "end, I pray
you, my existence!"
</p>

<p>
"That I may not do; and I pray you to avoid
me when next we meet."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" asked Huske, incoherently.
</p>

<p>
"Where the angel of death is hovering&mdash;on the
hills of Glensheil," replied Rob Roy, as he sprang
up some rocks that were close by and disappeared;
for at that moment an officer named Captain
Dawnes, who had heard the explosion of the
pistol, came hurriedly up with some twenty men
of the picket, all with their bayonets fixed.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap44"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIV.
<br><br>
THE BATTLE OF GLENSHEIL,
</h3>

<p>
By sunrise on the 10th of June, the shrill pipes
playing "Tulloch Ard" (the gathering and war-cry
of the MacKenzies) rang in Glensheil, the dwelling
place of the wild MacRaes, as the British redcoats,
and the Dutch in yellow uniforms, were seen to
enter that beautiful valley, which is fifteen miles in
length, forming line by regiments as they advanced
into the open space.
</p>

<p>
The Marquises of Seaforth and Tullybardine, as
the loyalists termed both, with Rob Roy, took up a
position at the narrow pass of Strachells, the
highest part of Glensheil.  With them was an
expatriated chieftain, Campbell of Glendaruail&mdash;a
place which means the Vale of Red Blood, where
Magnus, King of Norway, perished with his army
in defeat.
</p>

<p>
The first troops that appeared were Harrison's
Foot, a wing of the 15th Regiment, which thirty
years before fought against Viscount Dundee at the
battle of Killycrankie.  They had philemot yellow
facings, and coats elaborately laced with white
braid.
</p>

<p>
On their left were some of the clans who were
adverse to the House of Stuart, the Munroes in gay
scarlet tartans, the Rosses, Sutherlands, and others,
whose appearance in the ranks of the enemy filled
the insurgent Highlanders with rage; and in front
of the Rosses marched a tall grey-bearded harper,
playing on his harp.  This was Gillian Ross, who
had guided the MacGregors to Glensheil; and Rob
Roy vowed, if he came within arm's length of him,
to "tear his chords asunder."
</p>

<p>
The other corps came up in succession, and
gradually formed across the valley, the Grenadiers
marching in front of the line, with their pouches
open and fuses lighted.
</p>

<p>
General Wightman, a Dutch colonel named
Van Rasmusson, and Major Huske alone were
mounted.
</p>

<p>
Seaforth's men, including the MacRaes, under
Duncan nan Creagh, were about a thousand strong,
and all armed in the usual Highland fashion.  On
their left were six companies of Spanish Infantry
under Colonel Don Alonzo de Santarem, and his
brother Don JosÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, a Knight of Malta.  A quarter
of a mile eastward on their left flank were posted
the MacGregors under Rob Roy, whose orders
were to make an attack upon the enemy in flank.
</p>

<p>
On perceiving how the insurgents were posted,
and that they had formed a breastwork (which still
remains) to protect the pass, Wightman sent
forward a line of skirmishers, who were completely
exposed to the long muskets and deadly aim of the
Highland marksmen.  Thus, during the sharpshooting
only one MacKenzie fell, while Huske's
horse was shot under him, and many soldiers of the
line were killed and wounded.
</p>

<p>
Here the clan of Munro, becoming impatient,
made a rush forward, but were driven back by the
MacKenzies and Spaniards, and their leader, George
Munro of Culcairn, fell severely wounded.  As the
Spaniards continued to fire at or over him, while he
lay on the ground, he said to his servant, who was
also his foster-brother, and who lingered
affectionately beside him,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Retire; leave me to my fate; but say to my
father that I died here with honour, and as became
the race we spring from."
</p>

<p>
"Never," replied the other, bursting into tears;
"how can you suppose that I would forsake you
now?  No, no, George Munro; I will save you if
I can, or remain and die with you!"
</p>

<p>
He then spread himself and his plaid over the
body of Culcairn, to interrupt the balls of the
Spaniards, and received several severe wounds
before they were both rescued and dragged off the
field by a sergeant of the Munroes, who had sworn
upon his dirk&mdash;the Holy Iron&mdash;to accomplish the
deliverance of his leader.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this, the MacGregors had been&mdash;<i>repulsed</i>!
</p>

<p>
"Rob Roy," says the new statistical account
of Scotland, "acted with more zeal than judgment
by attacking the <i>rear</i> of the enemy, before their
front became engaged."
</p>

<p>
On seeing the steady array of red and yellow
uniforms advancing, the impetuosity of his men
could no longer be restrained by the same rules
of discipline which ordered Don Alonzo and his six
companies of Spaniards.
</p>

<p>
"Strike up, Alpine!" cried Rob to his piper;
"fall on, my lads, and cleave them down as a boy
would cleave the thistles!"
</p>

<p>
Then in the usual Highland fashion, the whole
tribe came down like a living flood upon the foe,
with their uplifted swords flashing in the sunshine.
An officer thus describes the <i>fine</i> motions of a
Highlander when charging:&mdash;"His first motion when
descending to battle was to place his bonnet firmly
on his head by an emphatic <i>scrug</i>; his second, to
cast off his plaid; his third, to incline his body
horizontally forward, cover it with his target, rush
to within fifty paces of the enemy's line, discharge
and drop his fusee or rifle; his fourth, to dart
within twelve paces, discharge and fling his
iron-stocked pistols at the foeman's head; his fifth, to
draw claymore and at him!"
</p>

<p>
The MacGregors wheeled round in a half circle,
fired their muskets and pistols, and then fell on the
rear of the Dutch and 15th, who faced about and
received them on their bayonets, while some
companies of the second line opened an oblique fire
which drove them back in rout and confusion; not,
however, until Rob had actually his hand upon a
regimental colour, after which, closing up hand to
hand with the Dutch colonel, Van Rasmusson, he
unhorsed and slew him.  Dawnes, a captain of the
15th, came rushing to the rescue of the Dutchman;
but a pistol-shot broke the blade of his sword near
the hilt just as Rob was closing on him.
</p>

<p>
"Pass on," said MacGregor, nobly, as he saluted
with his sword the defenceless officer, who almost
immediately after was killed by a stray bullet.
</p>

<p>
Driven up the hill in confusion and rage, the
MacGregors now joined the MacKenzies and MacRaes
in defence of the pass; but previous to this, a
young clansman named Eoin MacPhadrig (John, son
of Patrick MacGregor) rushed back furiously among
the Dutch like a tiger, and slew five of them before he
was bayoneted and killed.  With a thousand
reverberations the steep hills echoed the reports of the
firearms, the cries of the wounded, and the cheers
of the combatants, as the lines drew closer.
</p>

<p>
General Wightman now recalled his skirmishers,
and ordered the Grenadiers to advance.  They did
so, blowing their matches and throwing their
hand-grenades as fast as possible.  By the bursting of
these, several Highlanders were wounded, and Lord
Seaforth fell severely injured by a splinter, while to
add still more to the confusion and sufferings of the
wounded, the heather, which was dry as tinder, soft,
and deeply rooted, caught fire by these explosions,
and now sheets of flame rolled up the mountain
sides, with clouds of murky smoke.
</p>

<p>
Under cover of this the British and Dutch
infantry made no less than three desperate attacks
upon the insurgents, but were repulsed, and, after a
three hours' engagement, these combined forces
had to retire, leaving the Highlanders in complete
possession of the pass, where, according to Wightman's
despatch, lay one hundred and forty-two of
his soldiers, killed and wounded.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Captain Dawnes and two lieutenants of the 15th were
killed; Captains Moore and Heighington of the 14th were
wounded; Culcairn's thigh was broken.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Next day, seeing the utter futility of further
resistance, Don Alonzo, whose Spaniards were
naturally cold and indifferent to the cause, and who
had suffered in the conflict, surrendered the
survivors, two hundred and seventy-four in number, to
Major Huske, as prisoners of war.
</p>

<p>
On this the MacKenzies and MacRaes dispersed
to places where none could follow them; and
Wightman began his retreat for Edinburgh, a march of
more than a hundred and fifty miles.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis of Tullybardine, the Earls Marischal
and Seaforth, and Sir James Livingstone, after long
concealment, and though ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£2,000 were offered for
each of their heads, escaped and reached the
Continent in safety; and thus ended, says Salmon,
"this mighty Spanish invasion, which had so much
alarmed the three kingdoms."  Traces of this
conflict are still to be seen.  Gun-barrels and bullets
are found in the valley, and especially behind the
manse of Glensheil, where the Spaniards, before
surrendering, blew up their magazine; and there is
yet shown the green grave of the Dutch colonel,
Van Rasmusson, who fell by the hand of Rob Roy,
near the small cascade which flows into the glen.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLV.
<br><br>
THE KNIGHT OF MALTA.
</h3>

<p>
Rob Roy and his followers being now left to
themselves by the sudden dispersion of the MacKenzies
and MacRaes, while the Rosses, Munroes, and
others were still in arms against them, and while
General Wightman's troops, though retreating,
covered the main roads that led to the Perthshire
highlands, were thus compelled to linger near the
shore of Loch Duich and in the castle of Eilan
Donan for a few days ere they could set out on
their return home.
</p>

<p>
In the historical account of Rob Roy and his
clan, we are told briefly, that after Glensheil, "he
and his party plundered a Spanish ship, after it
had been in possession of the English, which so
enriched him that he went to the braes of
Balquhidder, and began farming."
</p>

<p>
The details of this affair are as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
On the night after the battle, Rob, on learning
that Duncan nan Creagh and other MacRaes were
wandering over the field, dirking and plundering
the wounded, went there to drive them off, and to
save as many as possible of the poor fellows.
</p>

<p>
The early June morning dawned brightly in the
dewy glen, which was dotted thickly with red
and yellow coats, among whom lay nearly thirty
Spaniards; and Rob saw with regret the body of
Captain Dawnes; it presented a deplorable spectacle,
for both his eyes were shot out, and his face
was a mass of blood.
</p>

<p>
Near him was a Spanish officer, seated half upright
against a large stone; his dark-olive face was pale,
ghastly, and sorrowful.  As Rob approached, he
raised his head, and opened his black and now
lack-lustre eyes with a vacant stare, as if the poor fellow
sought to assure himself that blindness and death
had not yet come upon him.  His uniform was blue,
richly laced with silver, and on his left breast was
the gold and eight-pointed cross of Malta.  He
had received two bullet wounds in the body, and
appeared to be sinking fast.
</p>

<p>
As Rob Roy, like most of the loyal Highlanders,
was perhaps more a Catholic than a Protestant, the
cross upon the breast of the dying Spaniard excited
his interest, and stooping down, he asked in
English if he could assist him.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Aqua&mdash;aqua!</i>" (water&mdash;water!) muttered the
sufferer, hoarsely, and then added in good English,
"Water, for the love of Heaven!"
</p>

<p>
"Run to the linn, Greumoch, and fill your
quaich," said Rob, raising the sufferer against his
knee; "our forefathers lie under the shadow of the
old cross on Inchcailloch, and they died believing in
it as the sign of redemption unto men, so it would
ill become us to neglect the stranger, who, with the
cross on his breast, dies here for King James VIII.
Quick, Greumoch, dash in some whisky too&mdash;it
comes not amiss to the Saxons, and won't to the
Spaniards!"
</p>

<p>
As soon as it was brought, he applied the quaich
of cool spring water and usquebaugh to the parched
lips of the wounded officer, whose tongue seemed to
have become baked and hard by loss of blood and
a night of agony.
</p>

<p>
Rob now proposed to have his wounds looked to
and the blood stanched; but there were no surgeons
near, and the Spaniard shook his head sadly,
as if to indicate that their efforts were useless,
and his eyes dilated wildly when Greumoch
approached him with a bunch of wild nettles, the old
Highland panacea for all manner of cuts, stabs,
and slashes.
</p>

<p>
Then the Spanish cavalier smiled sadly, for he
knew that he was mortally wounded, and felt death
in his heart.
</p>

<p>
"What is your name&mdash;your rank?" asked Rob, kindly.
</p>

<p>
"I am Don JosÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© de Santarem, a Knight of Malta."
</p>

<p>
"A relation of the Spanish colonel?"
</p>

<p>
"I am his brother; but Alonzo has left me to
my fate."
</p>

<p>
"Upbraid him not," said Rob; "he has been
sorely pressed by the men of Culcairn and Morar
Chattu, and is far down the glen by this time."
</p>

<p>
Had Rob said that he was "sorely pressed by
the Medes and Persians," it would have been quite
as intelligible to the Spaniard, who said,&mdash;"Senor
Escosse, could you get me a priest?"
</p>

<p>
"A priest!" reiterated Rob, with perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"That I may confess me before I die."
</p>

<p>
MacGregor shook his head.  "The priests are
all banished or in their graves," said he; "the
faith of our forefathers is proscribed here now&mdash;even
as the Clan Alpine are proscribed by the Parliament
and paper courts of the Lowlanders."
</p>

<p>
"No priests?" sighed the Spaniard, with a start.
</p>

<p>
"Not one," said Rob, on which Greumoch, who
knew a little English, whispered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Maybe Paul Crubach might do&mdash;he was mighty
near being a priest once."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no," said Rob.  "Yet there is the parish
minister of Glensheil."
</p>

<p>
But the Spaniard shook his head with disdain,
and the blood spirted anew from his wounds.
</p>

<p>
"My forefathers lie buried in the chapel of our
old castle at Quebara, in Alava&mdash;each under marble,
with helmet, sword, and gloves of steel above his
tomb; but I, a brother of St. John of Malta, must
lie here among heretics, and, it may be, in earth
that is unconsecrated otherwise than by the blessed
dew of heaven!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Rob, earnestly; "this shall not be!
You are dying, my brave man&mdash;I can see death in
your face, for I have seen it in the faces of too many
not to know it now; but I swear that you shall lie
in consecrated earth."
</p>

<p>
"Swear this to me!" gasped the Spaniard,
writhing his body towards the speaker, whose hand
he grasped convulsively.
</p>

<p>
"I swear it!" said Rob, pressing his dirk to
his lips.
</p>

<p>
"You vow on your steel, as we do in my
country," said the Spaniard, while his eyes sparkled
with an unwonted light; "listen to me&mdash;I will
reward you, if I can."
</p>

<p>
"I seek no reward," said Rob Roy; "you are
a Spaniard who came hither to fight for our king,
and against those lumbering louts, the Dutch, who
came from King William's country&mdash;bodachs, who
know not a stag's horn from a steer's stump, as the
saying is."
</p>

<p>
"Alas! (<i>ay de mi!</i>) how little I thought to die
in this wild land," said the Spaniard, closing his
eyes, while his voice became more and more
husky; "but draw nearer; keep your oath, and I
shall reward you.  I had charge of our treasure
chest; it contains three thousand pistoles of Madrid
and Malaga."
</p>

<p>
"And where is this chest?" whispered Rob,
very naturally becoming more interested.
</p>

<p>
"It is on board a small galley or launch&mdash;which&mdash;which
lies wedged&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where&mdash;where?" asked MacGregor; for the
Spaniard's voice and powers were failing fast.
</p>

<p>
"Wedged among the rocks, near where we
formed a battery&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"At the mouth of Loch Duich?"
</p>

<p>
"I know not how you name it&mdash;but 'tis there&mdash;there!"
</p>

<p>
"Good; speak on."
</p>

<p>
"Three British ships of war are hovering off the
coast, and that treasure will become their prize, if
you do not anticipate them.  The pistoles are&mdash;are&mdash;are
in a coffer marked with the cross of Malta."  After
this, the poor Spaniard relinquished his English,
which was very broken, and began to talk and
pray incoherently in Spanish and Latin, till gradually
he became insensible, and in less than an hour had
ceased to exist.
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy kept his word, and as soon as Don JosÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©
was dead, he wrapped him up in a plaid, and
conveyed him, with Alpine playing a lament in front, to
Killduich, and there buried him at the east end
of that ancient church, in a grave over which he
placed a rough wooden cross, and above which all
his followers fired thrice their muskets and pistols
in the air.
</p>

<p>
That the Colonel Don Alonzo de Santarem did
not endeavour to secure the military chest before
surrendering to General Wightman, was probably
because he was menaced by the Clans of Ross and
Munro, who hovered between him and the sea, and
by threatening his little camp, ultimately enforced
his capitulation.
</p>

<p>
Rob now instantly seized boats, and with half his
followers departed in search of what he termed,
"the Spaniard's legacy;" while Greumoch, with
the rest, occupied the castle of Eilan Donan, to
await his return.  It was evening now.  After a
long and careful search&mdash;a search which a dense
fog impeded&mdash;in a sequestered creek of Loch
Duich, the MacGregors found the craft they sought,
partly jammed upon a reef.  She appeared to be
the large, half-decked launch of one of the Spanish
frigates, both of which had now put to sea and
disappeared.  She lay in a deep chasm of the wild
rocks, at the base of a steep mountain, the sides of
which had been bared and rent by the <i>scriddans</i> of
a thousand years&mdash;for so the natives term those
water-torrents which at times hurl down gravel and
massive stones, in vast heaps, to desolate the fields,
the shore, or whatever may lie at the foot of these
rugged hills in Kintail and Glensheil.
</p>

<p>
Here dense green ivy covered the brows of the
chasm that beetled over the sea, and under it the
hawks, the wild pigeons, and the sea-birds built
their nests.  Lower down were holes and fissures,
in which the crabs and lobsters lurked, till the
countrywomen came in boats to drag them out with
old corn sickles, or other iron instruments, and by
their songs and voices to scare the sea-dogs
from the ledges, where they lay basking in the
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
The launch was mounted with pateraroes, but
how she came to be in such a situation we have no
means of knowing; her crew, which consisted of
some thirty Spanish seamen, though all well armed,
jumped out of her, and fled up the rocks on the
appearance of the MacGregors, as they knew not
whether they were friends or foes, and were scared
by their singular costume and bare limbs.
</p>

<p>
This craft, which was undoubtedly the launch
of one of the frigates (that is, a boat of the largest
size, for carrying great weight), had a kind of
half-deck forward; and under the hatch of this, which
was well secured by locks, bars, and iron bands,
Rob had no doubt the money lay.  Just as he and
a number of his followers sprang on board, a shout
from some of them who were higher up on the
rocks drew his attention to seaward.
</p>

<p>
The fog had risen now, like the lower end of a
thick grey curtain, showing the offing of Loch Alsh
sparkling in silver ripples under the rising moon,
and there, creeping along the shore, were three
British frigates&mdash;doubtless the three of which the
dying Spaniard had spoken&mdash;under easy sail, with
their topsails, white as snow, glittering in the
silvery sheen, though darkness yet obscured their
lower sails and hulls.
</p>

<p>
Right before the wind they had been standing up
Loch Alsh, and slightly altering their course, were
now penetrating that branch of it which is named
Loch Duich.
</p>

<p><a id="chap46"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVI.
<br><br>
EILAN DONAN.
</h3>

<p>
Sailing up Loch Duich, favoured by the fog, they
had approached unseen to within a mile of where
the Spanish launch lay in the creek, and midway
between were three large armed boats, full of
seamen and marines, pulling in shoreward with
long and easy strokes.  Up, up went the fog from
the bosom of the brightening lake,&mdash;up the steep
slopes of the dark mountains; and now the full
splendour of the moon shone along the deep and
narrow arm of the Atlantic, showing the bayonets,
cutlasses, and broad-bladed oars, as they flashed
and glittered in her silver rays.  These vessels
were the <i>Mermaid</i>, the <i>Dover</i>, and the <i>Stirling
Castle</i>, three thirty-gun ships or fourth-rates.  The
latter was one of the old Scottish fleet amalgamated
with the English at the union, when Scotland had a
complete set of frigates named after her royal
palaces and castles.
</p>

<p>
The sudden appearance and close proximity of
their approaching foes somewhat disconcerted even
the MacGregors; but Rob, who was full of strategy,
formed his plans in a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Dioul!" said he; "to have this prize&mdash;the
Spaniard's legacy&mdash;torn out of our teeth at this
moment will never do!  We must draw the attention
of these Sassenachs to another point."
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;how?" asked his followers.
</p>

<p>
"By firing on them."
</p>

<p>
"But they are beyond range!"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Rob; "they will soon be
within it."
</p>

<p>
"Your plan&mdash;your plan?" asked some, with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
He sent twenty of his best marksmen with all
speed to a point of rock about a quarter of a mile
above where the launch lay, with orders to lure the
enemy along the shore.
</p>

<p>
"Away, lads," said he, "and join us at Eilan Donan."
</p>

<p>
Running with the speed of hares, the MacGregors
scampered over the rocks, loading their long Spanish
guns as they went, and on gaining the place
indicated, crouched among the whins and heather, from
whence they opened a fire on the boats, which were
barely yet within range of the firearms then in use.
Flash, flash, flash, went the muskets redly out of the
dark obscurity along the rocky shore, and a thousand
echoes repeated the reports.
</p>

<p>
The challenge was soon accepted.  A cheer rang
across the shining lake from the man-of-war boats,
and with fresh energy the oarsmen bent them to the
task of rowing.  Ere long the marines and small-arm
men began to reply with their muskets; but they
never hit one of the MacGregors, who were protected
and concealed by bushes, boulder-stones, and ridges
of rock; while the crowded boats presented a large
mark for their muskets, which they could level
steadily over the objects which protected them.
</p>

<p>
Leaping from rock to rock and from bush to bush,
stooping down to reload, and starting up to fire, the
MacGregors lured the boats' crews for nearly two
miles up the loch in search of a landing-place, and
then left them; for the whole twenty marksmen,
with a shout of defiance and derision, plunged down
a dark ravine, and took their way leisurely to Eilan
Donan, without one of them being injured, while,
on the other side, several unfortunate fellows were
killed and wounded in the baffled boats of the
frigates.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime Rob Roy was not idle on board
the launch.
</p>

<p>
The hatch of the foredeck was soon burst open,
and the black coffer described by the knight of
Malta as being the military chest of the Spanish
expedition&mdash;at least, of that portion which his
brother commanded&mdash;was found.  It was speedily
forced, and there, in canvas bags, were found the
heavy gold pistoles of Madrid and Malaga, each of
which was worth sixteen shillings and ninepence
sterling.
</p>

<p>
While the firing between the marksmen and the
boats' crews was proceeding briskly, but receding
up the loch, and while the frigates with their
starboard tacks on board, crept closer and closer in
shore, till Rob could hear the voice of the leadsman
in the forechains of each as they sounded constantly
in these, to them, almost unknown waters, he and his
men were filling their dorlachs, or haversacks, with
the treasure, after which they eat and drank all the
provisions and liquors found in the launch, chiefly a
bag of biscuits and a keg of brandy.
</p>

<p>
Then, to prevent the boat from becoming a prize
to any of the king's ships, he ordered her to be set
on fire, which was speedily done by thrusting bundles
of dry branches and tarred rope under the foredeck,
where her sails were stowed, and then applying a
light.
</p>

<p>
The launch burned rapidly.  The glare of the
conflagration and explosion of the pateraroes as
they became heated, soon attracted the attention of
the boats' crews, and brought them down the loch,
pulling with all their speed; but ere they reached
the creek there remained only a heap of charred and
smouldering wood, with the brass swivels or
pateraroes, lying among it.  By this time Rob Roy and
his men had crossed the intervening hills, and were
far on their way to Lord Seaforth's castle of Eilan
Donan.
</p>

<p>
They soon reached this fine old fortress, which
had been built by Alexander III. to protect Loch
Duich from the Danes, and of which he made Colin
Fitzgerald (a brave Irishman, who served under his
banner at the victory of Largs) the first constable,
in the year 1263.  It consisted of a square keep, the
walls of which measured four feet thick.  It was
surrounded by an outer rampart, and by water at
full tide.  Eilan Donan was a place of great strength,
and the keep was lofty and spacious.  The oldest
parishioner (in 1793) remembered to have seen
Duncan nan Creagh and other Kintail men under
arms on its leaden roof, and dancing there merrily,
ere they marched to the battle of Sheriffmuir, from
whence few of them ever returned.
</p>

<p>
Here Rob Hoy and the MacGregors took up their
quarters.  Roaring fires were lighted in the great
kitchen, and a couple of deer were soon roasting
and sputtering on the spits, while ale and
usquebaugh went joyously round in quaichs, cups, and
long blackjacks in the hall, where the spoil&mdash;the
treasure of the Spanish launch&mdash;was fairly portioned
out, every man sharing alike, while a large sum was
put aside for old and poor folks at home, not
forgetting even Paul Crubach.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of all this the boom of a distant
cannon was heard; another and another followed;
and then a tremendous crash, as a 24-pound shot
passed through the windows of the hall and tore
down a mass of masonry opposite.
</p>

<p>
All rushed to the windows or to the roof, and lo! with
their broadsides to the shore, there lay two of
the frigates, the <i>Mermaid</i>, under Commander Samuel
Goodiere, and the <i>Dover</i>, under Nicolas Robertson,
with their foreyards backed, and opened ports, from
which the red flashes of the ordnance broke
incessantly, as they commenced a vigorous cannonade on
Eilan Donan, which they had special orders to
destroy, as a stronghold of the house of Seaforth.
</p>

<p>
"This is no place for us now, lads," said Rob,
"so, ho for the march home.  We have many a step
between this and Balquhidder, so the sooner we
depart the better."
</p>

<p>
Dislodged thus unexpectedly from Eilan Donan,
to reach the mainland Rob and his hardy followers
forded that portion of the isthmus which lay under
water when the tide was at half ebb, and just as the
clear summer twilight was brightening into day,
they retired among the mountains that look down
on the Sheil.
</p>

<p>
For some hours they could hear the din of the
cannonade against Eilan Donan, which was so completely
battered and destroyed, that little or nothing
remains of it now, save its foundations, and a well
in which, a few years ago, a quantity of plate and
firearms was discovered.  Several of the cannon-balls
fired on this occasion have been found from
time to time by the country people, who used them
as weights for the sale of butter and cheese.
</p>

<p>
Not content with the demolition of the castle, the
commanders of the frigates landed their crews, and
with great wantonness burned the old church of
Killduich to the ground, and pillaged the poor
peasantry.
</p>

<p>
This severity was not unrequited by fate; for
we learn from Shomberg's "Naval Chronology,"
that Captain Nicolas Robertson was soon after tried
by a court-martial for keeping false musters and
defrauding the Government, in whose cause he was
so zealous when in the Highland lochs; and on the
4th April, 1740, Samuel Goodiere, then a captain,
was hanged for the murder of his own brother on
board H.M.S. <i>Ruby</i> in the Bristol Channel.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVII.
<br><br>
THE HARPER'S RANSOM.
</h3>

<p>
Towards the evening of the next day the
MacGregors, on their homeward march, found themselves
in the country of the Camerons, at the head
of Loch Arkeig, a long and narrow sheet of water,
lying between rugged mountains, and stretching
far away towards Glen Mhor n'Albyn, or the great
valley of Caledonia, which runs diagonally across
the kingdom from the German Sea to the Atlantic.
They bivouacked at the head of the loch, lighted a
fire, and having no enemies in the neighbourhood,
prepared to pass the night pleasantly, wrapped in
their plaids, on the soft blooming heather; but first
Rob Roy placed two sentinels on the drove road
that led to and from their halting-place, that perfect
security might not be neglected.
</p>

<p>
The summer night was clear and warm, and every
star shone brightly amid the blue ether; all was
stillness and deep silence, save where a mountain
stream, a tributary of Loch Arkeig, swept down,
now over falls and stony rapids, or among bold
impending rocks spotted with lichens and tufted
with broom, and now among pale hazel groves and
black clumps of red-stemmed pine.
</p>

<p>
The MacGregors had scarcely been here two
hours, and, weary with their march and lulled by
the hum of the hurrying stream, most of them were
fast asleep, when Rob heard his sentinels in violent
altercation with a stranger; and as the Gaelic
language is deficient neither in expletives nor
maledictions, they were plentifully used on this occasion.
On sending Greumoch to ascertain the cause of all
this, he soon returned, with his drawn dirk gleaming
in one hand, while by the other he dragged
forward a harper, in whom, by the firelight, Rob
immediately recognized Gillian Ross the Islesman,
who had acted as their guide to Glensheil.
</p>

<p>
He was a man well up in years; his hair and
flowing beard were snowy white; but his cheek was
ruddy, and his eyes had a merry twinkle which
showed that as a son of song he had led a jovial
life and a roving one, though among turbulent
clans, in a wild country and in perilous times.
</p>

<p>
His kilt and plaid were of the Ross tartan, which
is gaily striped with red, green, and blue; and his
clairsach or little Scottish harp was slung on his
back by a belt, and covered with a case of tarpaulin
or tarred canvas&mdash;probably a piece of a boat-sail.
He carried a blackthorn stick, and as his occupation
was a peaceful one, he had no weapon save a dirk,
which, like the mouth-piece of his sporan, was gaily
adorned with silver.  "A spy, a spy!" cried the
MacGregors, starting up and crowding about him
with ominous expressions in their weatherbeaten faces.
</p>

<p>
"What is the meaning of this, thou son of the
son of Alpine?" he boldly demanded of Rob, in
his figurative Gaelic; "the children of the Gael
should not draw their swords on each other, and
still less on a son of song."
</p>

<p>
"Yet, son of song," replied Rob, drily, "you
played those Rosses and Munroes, and the men of
Morar Chattu, into battle against us near Dounan
Diarmed* in Glenshiel&mdash;the tomb of one whom
Ossian loved.  Eh, what say you to that?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A warrior of Fingal, whose grave lies near the manse of
Glensheil.  Morar Chattu is the Celtic name of the Earls of
Sutherland.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"There have been cold steel and hot blood
between our people," began the harper in a gentler
tone.
</p>

<p>
"True; but that was in the times of old; and
now the righteous cause of our king should make
even the false Whigs true, and every clan unite in
one."
</p>

<p>
"Even the Grahames with the Clan Alpine?"
said the harper, with a cunning smile.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;even the Grahames with the Clan Alpine!"
repeated Rob, stamping his foot on the heather.
"I could find in my heart forgiveness for them all,
would they but join the king."
</p>

<p>
"When that day comes, the lamb shall share the
lair of the lion, and the cushat-dove shall seek the
nest of gled and iolar," replied the harper, still
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Whence come you, and where is your home?"
</p>

<p>
"The Isle of the Pigmies, in the west&mdash;far away
amid the sea," replied the harper with a sigh;
"and would, MacGregor, I were there now, where
its black rocks are covered with sheets of snowy
foam, where the wild sea-birds wheel and scream
above the breakers, and where the level sunshine
and the rolling sea go far together into its gloomy
caves and weedy chasms."
</p>

<p>
The harper referred to one of the Western Isles,
a little solitary place, where stand the ruins of a
chapel, and where it was believed a dwarfish race
were buried of old; "for many strangers digging
deep into the earth have found, and do yet find,"
says Buchanan, "little round skulls and the
bones of small human bodies, that do not in
the least differ from the ancient reports concerning
pigmies."
</p>

<p>
"I am grieved, harper, that you should die so far
from your kindred and their burial-place," said Rob,
gravely.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Die!</i> wherefore should I die?" asked the harper,
starting, while his countenance fell.
</p>

<p>
"Oogh ay!" exclaimed several MacGregors,
who were yawning and crowding round; "just let
the bodach be hanged at once, and then we shall
go to sleep again."
</p>

<p>
"Or would you prefer to be drowned?" said
Greumoch; "Loch Arkeig is close by, and the
water there is warm and deep."
</p>

<p>
"Neither is my wish," said the harper, fiercely;
"I am a guiltless man, and demand my freedom!"
</p>

<p>
"Why were you in the ranks of the king's rebels
at Glensheil?" asked Rob, sternly.
</p>

<p>
"I was <i>not</i> in their ranks!"
</p>

<p>
"You played them into battle."
</p>

<p>
"But I fought not&mdash;nor was I even girded with
a sword."
</p>

<p>
"By my father's soul, that mattered little!  A
minstrel&mdash;a harper&mdash;should not play the traitor like
a glaiket gilly."
</p>

<p>
"I went but to sing of the fight, that the story
of it might go down to future times, even as the
battles of our forefathers have come down by the
songs of the bards to us.  I went but as Ian Lom
went with Montrose to Inverlochy.  Had he fought
there and fallen, who would have told us how he,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The bard of their battles, ascended the height<br>
  Where dark Inverlochy o'ershadowed the fight,<br>
  And saw the clan Donnell resistless in might!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Have you so committed to song our victory at
Glensheil?" asked MacGregor, with a sharp glance;
but the harper hung his head.  "Ha! then what
sought you <i>here</i> to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Was it to spy upon us?" added several
MacGregors, with scowling brows; "answer,
Islesman, while your skin is whole!"
</p>

<p>
"By the Black Stones of Iona, I swear that I
knew not you were in the land of Lochiel!" said
the harper, earnestly; "and beware how you spill
my blood, for my mother was one of the Camerons,
the sons of the Soldier of Ovi.  I was peacefully
pursuing my way to the fair of Kill-chuimin."
</p>

<p>
"It may be so," said Rob Roy; "for that fair is
almost at hand.  Tie him to a tree; in the morning,
I will speak with him again."
</p>

<p>
The harper submitted in silence, and was bound
to a tree, when a plaid was thrown over him and his
harp, as a protection from the dew; and Greumoch,
with a true Highland grin or grimace, gave him a
dram, saying, "As it is the last you are likely to
get, drain the quaich."
</p>

<p>
By dawn the MacGregors were all afoot again;
they wiped and rubbed their weapons to preserve
them from rust; shook the crystal dew from their
kilts and plaids; then the pipes struck up a quick
step, and they proceeded on their homeward way,
taking with them the harper, concerning whom Rob
Roy had given no instructions, for he was loth to
punish him, though deeming that he deserved to
be so.
</p>

<p>
For two days he conveyed him thus a prisoner,
telling him that if he was actually going to the fair
of Kill-chuimin (or the burial-place of the Cumins,
as the Highlanders called Port Augustus) his time
would not be lost, as their way lay so far together.
</p>

<p>
Towards the evening of the second day, they
halted on a wild moorland waste, called Blair na
Carrahan, or the moor of the circles, for there amid
the vast expanse of purple heather were several
large Druidical rings, wherein, it was confidently
affirmed, the fairies always danced on the Eve of
St. John; but more especially around a large obelisk
which stood in the centre of one, and was covered
with Runic figures.
</p>

<p>
When they halted in this desolate place, the
harper became alarmed, and begged so earnestly
to be released, that Rob said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You must ransom yourself&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ransom!&mdash;do you speak of ransom to one who
has not in the world a coin the size of a herring
scale?"
</p>

<p>
"Ransom yourself by a song or a story, I was
about to say.  If either meet with the general
approval of my kinsmen, you shall be free&mdash;free as
the winds that shake the harebells and the broom
on the braes of Balquhidder; but fail us in song or
story, and by the Grey Stone in Glenfruin, you shall
hang&mdash;hang like the false cullion I deem you!"
</p>

<p>
Gillian Ross made a double Highland bow; the
cord was taken from his wrists, and slung with a
noose of very unpleasant aspect over the Druid
monolith, for thereon he was to hang, if he failed
to win the general applause.
</p>

<p>
The poor harper eyed it wistfully, and then seated
himself on the green grass in the centre of the fairy
circle, around which the MacGregors were lounging,
with their arms beside them.  He uncased his harp;
and after running his fingers rapidly through the
strings, suddenly seemed to change his intention to
sing, and said he would tell them a story.  A
murmur of assent responded.
</p>

<p>
On that vast purple moorland, bounded in the
distance by the countless dark-blue mountain peaks
of Argyle, a picturesque group they formed, those
weather-beaten clansmen, in their garish tartans,
with their polished weapons, their round targets,
and bare legs stretched upon the heather.  Then
there was also the green fairy circle, in the centre
of which rose the grey old obelisk, and at its base
reclined the bearded harper on his harp.  The sun
as he set beyond the western peaks crimsoned like
a sheet of wine the heather of the Blair na Carrahan,
and tipped with ruddy light the harper's silver
beard and the glittering strings of his harp, as he
told the following story, which we render here, not
in his poetical and somewhat inflated Gaelic, but in
our own way.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVIII.
<br><br>
MORRAR NA SHEAN, OR THE LORD OF THE VENISON.
</h3>

<p>
Far away in the north of Caithness stands the
castle of Braal, on an eminence above the river
Thurso.  It is a vast square tower, with walls of
great thickness, having the narrow stairs which
lead to its various stories formed in the heart of
them.  A deep fosse lies on its north side, and the
remains of various other ditches and outworks are
traceable around it.
</p>

<p>
In the days of William I. of Scotland, surnamed
the Lion, because he first put that emblem on his
banners and seals, this castle was one of the many
residences of Harold Earl of Caithness and Count
of Orkney, Lord of Kirkwall, Braal, and Lochmore,
who was otherwise named Morrar na Shean, or
Lord of the Venison, from his passionate love of
hunting and all rural sports.
</p>

<p>
Yet his character was cruel, fierce, morose, and
savage; and he loved hunting chiefly because it
was a means of indulging in bloodshed, slaughter,
and destruction.
</p>

<p>
He brained with his axe every hound which
proved faulty; and on more than one occasion,
huntsmen who had erred, violated the rules of the
chase, or otherwise incurred his displeasure, were
tied to trees and left to be devoured by wolves.
One, named Magnus of Staneland, he chained to a
low rock in the sea, and left there to perish
miserably by drowning as the tide rose.
</p>

<p>
Harold was a handsome and stately man, of great
stature and strength.  His fair hair and beard were
curly and flowing; but his eyes were keen and
wicked in expression, and his brows were ever
knitted as if in perpetual defiance or wrath, unless
at times when, gorged with food or flushed with
wine, he joined in the chorus of the harpers who
sang his praises at his banquets and festivals.
</p>

<p>
He could bend a stronger bow than three men
could bend together.  He was wont to twirl three
sharp swords at once, catching each by its hilt in
turn; and he could walk lightly and agilely along
the oars of his great birlinn, or galley, when it was
being propelled by the rowers, most of whom were
Finns or Wends, whom he had captured in the
Baltic and chained to its benches as slaves.
</p>

<p>
Though he gave vast sums towards the completion
of the cathedral church of St. Magnus, which
had been founded at Kirkwall by his predecessor,
Count Rognwald of Orkney, in 1138, he was
averred to be at heart an infidel; and Adam Bishop
of Caithness, an amiable and gentle prelate, who
frequently reproved his excesses, once said to
him,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Earl Harold, are you a heathen or a believer?
Do you hope for the Valhalla of Odin or the Heaven
of the Christians?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe in my strong arm and sharp sword,"
said he, haughtily.  "Am I a woman or a boy, that
thou, a mitred monk, shouldst question me thus?
Moreover, remember that I would rather be
addressed as Morrar na Shean&mdash;Lord of the
Venison&mdash;than as lord of all our uncounted isles."
</p>

<p>
And from that time he hated the old bishop in
his heart; so much so, that John of Harpidale, one
of his chief followers, proposed to have the prelate
boiled alive in the great hunting cauldron, and
given in broth to their hounds.
</p>

<p>
The earl's galley had thirty benches of rowers; its
prow was adorned by the head of a horse, richly
gilded, and its sides and stern shone with gilding
and plates of burnished brass; its sails were purple,
and along its sides hung the shields of John of
Harpidale, Thorolf Starkadder, and others, who
were his vassals.  In its prow sat twenty bearded
harpers, with their harps, and to their songs the
long sweeps of the rowers kept time.
</p>

<p>
Wolves are said to have followed this great
war-galley along the shore, and screaming eagles,
carrion crows, and other birds ventured out to
sea in expectation of the banquet that awaited
them; for in his quarrels and feuds with his
island neighbours, Morrar na Shean carried havoc
and dismay wherever he went, and frequently
appropriated, without inquiry, the ships that
sailed between the Baltic coasts, the Elbe, and
Flanders.
</p>

<p>
Then when his galley, with its purple sails
shining in the sun, and its long red streamers
floating on the wind, was seen cleaving with gilded
prow the stormy seas that roll round the Orcades
and Thule, it spread terror, for the simple people of
the isles believed it had been built by the gnomes
who abode in the sea-riven caves of Cape Wrath,
and that they had constructed it with such powerful
spells, that whenever the sails were spread, they
directed its course wherever the earl wished, without
an order being issued.
</p>

<p>
On the 16th of April, 1150, the festival of
St. Magnus the Martyr, John of Harpidale and Thorolf
Starkadder, on feeling some unpleasant twinges of
temporary compunction for their misdeeds, urged
the earl to visit either Rome or Kirkwall; for so
great was the sanctity of the Patron of the Isles,
that the Orcadians were long wont to decide by a
throw of the dice whether they should pay their
devotions at the shrine of St. Peter or the Martyr
of Orkney.
</p>

<p>
But Morrar na Shean laughed at them, and swore
with a great oath that he would visit neither, as he
had merrier work to do.  Then, collecting a great
train of followers, he sailed away north, up the
Cattegat, to the assistance of the King of Denmark,
Waldemar the Great, who had recently repaired the
wall of Gotrick, subdued the pagans of Rugen, and
called himself lord of all the countries northward of
the Elbe.
</p>

<p>
Earl Harold was long gone, and silence and
emptiness reigned in the hall and chambers of
Braal; but there were peace and repose in Caithness
and the Isles.  The red deer roamed on the hills,
unscared by the bay of hound or the blast of horn;
without fear, the fishers put forth to cast their nets
in Scapa Flow and the Sound of Yell, to hunt the
huge whale in the sandy bays, or the tusky walrus
on the seaweedy rocks; and the white-haired
Bishop of Caithness began to hope that they
had all seen the last of the terrible Morrar na
Shean.
</p>

<p>
But lo! one day, when the dark scud was driving
fast across the northern sky, when the boiling foam
rose high on every storm-beat cape and bluff, when
the wild sea-fowl were flying far inland, and the
hissing waves rolled white as snow over the Skerries
of the Pentland Firth and the black Boars of
Dungisbay Head, the well-known purple sails of the
great birlinn were seen, as she came flying through
the mist and spray, with her long sweeps flashing
and the sheen of helmets and bucklers glittering
above her bulwarks in the partial gleams of a
stormy setting sun.
</p>

<p>
Then fast went the news over continent and isle
that Morrar na Shean had come again, and that he
had brought with him, out of the distant north, the
Princess Gunhilda as his wife&mdash;the only daughter
of Waldemar, the Danish king; so many who
feared more than they loved him, crowded to see
the dame who was now to be the lady of Braal and
mother of the future Earls of Caithness and Counts
of Orkney.
</p>

<p>
With the wiry tinkle of harps, the blare of brass
trumpets and of hunting-horns, the voices of the
rowers mingling with the regular plash of the long
sweeps to which they were chained, the great galley
came into the Bay of Inver-thorsa (or the mouth of
the great river of Thor), whence Thurso takes its
name; and all the people of Caithness were crowding
on the shore, as thickly as the gulls and
cormorants that cluster on the rocky Clett, which
guards the entrance of the haven.
</p>

<p>
As she stepped ashore, the grace and beauty of
the Danish princess charmed all; but she seemed
pale and sad, for she had espoused the warlike
Harold in obedience only to her father's will.  Yet
they seemed a stately pair.
</p>

<p>
She wore a blue silk tunic, a long flowing mantle
of fine white cloth, adorned by ribands and tassels
of gold; a veil of rich lace flowed from under the
half-diadem which she wore above her golden
tresses in virtue of her rank as a king's daughter
and an earl's wife; and she had massive bracelets
and armlets of gold.
</p>

<p>
The fierce Harold wore his lurich, or shirt of
mail, that reached to his knees, which were bare.
It was formed of fine rings of the brightest steel.
He had long sandal-like boots of thick leather,
studded with gilt knobs; and a golden serpent
surmounted his helmet, which was of polished steel.
His mantle was of purple silk, and hung from his
shoulders by two sparkling brooches.
</p>

<p>
Massive bracelets of gold and silver were on his
wrists.  He carried a sword, a spear, a round shield
of steel burnished like a mirror, and wore at his
right side a mattacuslash, or long Scottish arm-pit
dagger.
</p>

<p>
John of Harpidale, Thorolf Starkadder, and
others, all similarly armed, leaped noisily ashore,
with helmets and hauberks ringing, and brandished
their swords in token of greeting to the people,
and to express joy on treading their native soil
again.
</p>

<p>
And now the gathered multitude divided like the
waves of the sea to make way for an aged man who
approached with a gilded pastoral staff in his hand,
but whose garments were humble as those of a
cowled friar.  He was Adam, Bishop of Caithness,
and lately Abbot of Melrose, who, preceded by his
crossbearer, and followed by many ecclesiastics
of his diocese, came to bless the newly-married pair.
</p>

<p>
The countess, though the daughter of a powerful
king, knelt reverently and humbly to receive the old
man's benison; but not so the haughty earl, who
had sworn never to bow his head to mortal man, so
he passed proudly on, and repaired to his castle of
Braal.
</p>

<p>
On the very day after his arrival, he quitted the
countess, and, accompanied by John of Harpidale,
by Thorolf Starkadder, and other favourite
companions, departed on one of his great hunting
expeditions.
</p>

<p>
There were with him more than five hundred
huntsmen, armed with bows, arrows, knives, and
spears; and they had with them at least two
hundred of the strong, wiry, rough-haired Scottish
hounds, to scour the hills for game.
</p>

<p>
For many days the sport was carried over hill and
through valley; and every night the hunters formed
a camp.  A fire was lighted of fuel piled up as high
a house, and often the houses of the poor were
unroofed for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
The glare of this great fire was visible at midnight
from the mountains of Pomona and the Pentland
Skerries far away out in the lonely ocean.  Around
it were scores of pots and kettles boiling salmon
and chickens; and thereat were heathcocks,
capercailzie, ptarmigan, venison, boars' hams, and
partridges, being baked, broiled, roasted, or stewed;
while ale, usquebaugh, and wines from Burgundy
and the Flemings of Ostende were drunk by the
roystering huntsmen, who often danced hand in
hand round the vast roaring pyramid of flame, as
their pagan sires were wont to do at the Baal-tein
feasts of old, and if one by chance fell in, the fun
was all the greater.
</p>

<p>
At times they would fill their cups to the brim.
and standing in a circle round Morrar na Shean,
whose goblet was full of wine, of ale, and of
usquebaugh mixed together, they shouted,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh! Lord, let the world be turned upside
down, that brave men may make bread out
of it!"
</p>

<p>
And then the cups were drained and, amid wild
hurrahs, flung high into the air.
</p>

<p>
Morrar na Shean, though he lived in so early an
age of Scottish history, was not without some skill
in mechanics, for we are informed that "there was
a chest or some kind of machine fixed in the mouth
of the stream below the castle (of Lochmore), for
catching salmon in their ingress into the loch, or
their egress out of it, and that immediately on the
fish being entangled in the machine, the capture
was announced to the family by the ringing of
a bell, which the struggles of the fish set in motion,
by means of a fine cord, one end of which was
attached to a bell in the middle of an upper
room, and the other end to the machine in the
stream below."
</p>

<p>
This was an ingenious fish-trap; but while the
Lord of the Venison pursued his more furious
sports and drunken orgies, the poor Princess
Gunhilda was left in utter loneliness at the castle of
Braal; and the long nights which her husband
spent in roystering among his wild followers, were
passed by her, often in tears, and at the deeply
arched windows of the lofty hall or of her bower
chamber, watching the merry dancers, the streamers
of the northern lights, which made her think of her
Danish home, of her mother's farewell kiss, of the
castle of Axel-huis, and the green, waving woods of
Zealand.
</p>

<p>
Harold was soon weary of his wife, for her
extreme gentleness tired him, and he loved her not,
though he longed for a son&mdash;a little Count of
Orkney&mdash;to heir his vast possessions, and in whose
baby face he might see his own ferocious visage
reflected.
</p>

<p>
He prayed at holy wells, and, candle in hand, he
went bare-foot in sackcloth garments, with ashes on
his head, to every shrine of sanctity in the Northern
Isles; he sent gifts to Adam the bishop, and offerings
to the altar of St. Magnus at Kirkwall, with
silver lamps, rich garments, candles of perfumed
wax, and jars of oil and wine; seeking in return of
the prebendaries only their prayers that he might
have a son; but on the Yule-day of 1153, the
countess had a daughter, whom she named after
her mother the queen, Algiva.
</p>

<p>
Morrar na Shean was furious with disappointment;
he reviled Bishop Adam, and threatened to
burn his cathedral, where prayers had proved of so
little avail.  Then for days and nights he sat
drinking with John of Harpidale and Thorolf Starkadder;
and thereafter ordering his great galley to be got in
readiness, they put to sea, and were driven by a
storm so far as Rona, a lonely isle which lies far
amid the Atlantic sea, thirty leagues westward of
the Orcades.  In Rona was a little chapel, dedicated
by a chief of the isles to St. Ronan, and it was said
to be guarded by an unseen spirit; for if any person
in the island died and a shovel was placed near the
altar overnight, a grave was found ready dug in the
morning.
</p>

<p>
The place was lonely and solemn, for no sound
was ever heard there but the sough of the gusty
sea-breeze, and the mournful moan of the white waves
as they clomb the echoing rocks.
</p>

<p>
Sad and soothing as was the scene, yet in sheer
despite at being driven so far away, Morrar and his
followers ravaged this poor place, destroyed the
chapel, and slew some of the people on the adjacent
island of Suliska.  But the vengeance of Heaven
pursued them; for when returning, the great galley
struck upon the Clett, a rock four hundred feet in
height, near the entrance of Thurso Bay, and many
of her crew were drowned.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this, Morrar na Shean had ceased to
address Heaven, and now appealed to the idols of
his forefathers.  He visited the Temple of the Moon
in Innistore, and at midnight, with strange barbaric
rites, on his bare knees, spilt some of his blood by
the self-inflicted stab of a dagger, on the central
stone of Power.
</p>

<p>
This was a great obelisk carved with serpents,
and the jormagundror great sea-snake, the emblem
of eternity; and with many mystic emblems and
Runic inscriptions; and there between midnight
and morn, he prayed for the assistance of the Moon,
of Odin, and Thor.  But all this mummery was
vain; for on his return he found that the countess
had given birth to <i>a second daughter</i>, whom she had
named Erica; and in the blindness of his wrath the
earl struck her with his hand clenched in his steel
glove, and threatened to toss the child from the
windows of Braal into the Thurso.
</p>

<p>
Again with John of Harpidale, with the long-bearded
Thorolf, and other roysterers, he put to sea
in the great galley, and sailed into the Baltic, where
they aided King Waldemar in the destruction of
the famous city of Iomsberg, the stronghold of the
northern pirates, whom on his return the earl
imitated, for he destroyed several towns on the shores
of the Baltic, and robbed the churches of their holy
vessels.  Then the earl sought the aid of enchanters
and wizards, and passed whole nights in dark
caverns and pine forests, where Druid circles stood,
hoping to see elves, demons, gnomes, or fairies, but
sought in vain.
</p>

<p>
He next sailed to the Isle of Rugen, where the
Wends were still, in the twelfth century, unbaptized
pagans, who worshipped Svantavit, the God of
Light, in their capital, Arcona, which is situated on
a high rock above the waves of the Baltic.
</p>

<p>
Svantavit was a monstrous idol having four heads;
but he was consulted as an oracle, and the captain
of every merchant ship which made a good voyage
was compelled to pay tribute to the priests of his
temple.
</p>

<p>
In the hands of this idol was a cornucopia, which
in the first month of every year was filled with
precious wine; by looking into what remained of it
at Yule-tide, the chief-priest could predict peace or
war, dearth or plenty for the ensuing year; and this
absurd paganism existed in Rugen until the middle
of the thirteenth century.  Ratzo, King of the Isle,
was a famous but aged warrior, who had destroyed
the flourishing city of Lubeck in 1134; so to him,
and to the chief-priest, the earl appealed, and laid
at the foot of their hideous idol in Arcona all the
plunder of the Christian churches&mdash;chalices of gold,
lamps of silver, croziers studded with precious stones,
and altar-cloths covered with embroidery.
</p>

<p>
The priest accepted the plunder, ascended a
ladder, and peeped into the horn in the hands of
the idol, where, as he averred, he could see amid
the wine the figure of a little boy, with an earl's
coronet on his head, and a sword in each hand.  So
Morrar na Shean with joy spread his purple sails
upon the northern sea, and came home to find that
the countess had brought into the world <i>a third
daughter</i>, whom she named Thora.  The earl was
ready to expire with passion.
</p>

<p>
"Let us return to Arcona!" said Thorolf Starkadder.
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose, fool?" asked the earl, gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"To destroy the temple of Svantavit, hang the
false priest, and burn his idol."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Morrar na Shean, grinding his
teeth.  "I shall take other vengeance upon fate,
for fate has conspired against me."
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;how?" asked his followers.
</p>

<p>
"Anon, ye shall hear!"
</p>

<p>
"Shall we not see?" asked Thorolf, grimly, for
he was a lover of mischief and cruelty.
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Morrar, briefly, as he gnawed his
yellow moustaches in wrath.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIX.
<br><br>
GUILT AND REMORSE OF MORRAR NA SHEAN.
</h3>

<p>
One evening, when twilight was closing on the
land and sea; when the clouds were gathering in
heavy masses that portended a storm, and when
the Thurso ran hoarsely and rapidly over its stony
bed beneath the castle wall, Harold commanded
the countess to assume her hood and cloak, and to
accompany him.  "Whither?" she asked, timidly,
for his manner was strange, and he was sorely
flushed with wine.
</p>

<p>
"Whither, matters not; but you shall learn
when we reach the place."
</p>

<p>
"Do we go on foot?" she inquired, trembling,
for there was a wild glare in his eyes that terrified
her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Alone&mdash;unattended?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he repeated, hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
Then the heart of the countess sank; but she was
compelled to obey.  Her husband grasped her
hand, and together they quitted the castle of
Braal by a private postern at the foot of a long
and secret stair.
</p>

<p>
Gunhilda was silent; she pressed her ivory
crucifix to her breast with her left hand, for it
was the parting gift of Absalon, Archbishop of
Denmark; her right was firmly grasped by her
husband, and she felt that <i>his</i> hand was cold:&mdash;yea,
cold as ice!
</p>

<p>
She had heard of his proceedings on the shores
of the Baltic, and how he had publicly worshipped
the God of the Wends at Rugen; her soul became
a prey to grief and horror, and beneath her veil
her tears flowed hot and fast.
</p>

<p>
He led her along the banks of the Thurso for
more than a mile, by a dark and lonely path.  No
one was near them; the hour was late, the place
was solitary, and the countess gazed anxiously
about her for succour, if required; but the pastoral
hills were desolate.  Even the sheep were in their
folds, and there came no sound to her ear, save the
rush of the dark and hurrying stream.
</p>

<p>
It was a night in the pleasant month of June,
and in that part of Scotland at this season there
is scarcely any darkness, the reflection of the sun
on the Atlantic being so distinctly visible for the
brief time that he is below the horizon, that
one may read the smallest print even at midnight.
</p>

<p>
As they drew near a little chapel which stood
upon a rock above the river, and was dedicated to
St. Monina, the countess gathered courage, and
said,&mdash;"Unless you say, my lord, for what purpose
you have brought me hither in this secret manner,
and at this unwonted hour, I go not one step
further with you!"
</p>

<p>
"Listen," said he, drawing his long arm-pit
dagger, while a cruel and wild glare came into his
fierce blue eyes; "I have brought you hither to
slay you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my soul foreboded as much!" said Gunhilda,
in a breathless voice; "to slay me&mdash;for
what?  What crime have I committed?"
</p>

<p>
"None; yet I will not have a wife who is to be
the mother of baby-faced girls, whose husbands,
if they get them, will rend and divide my heritage
among them.  I must have a son to heir me, as Earl
of Caithness, Count of Orkney, Lord of Braal and
Lochmore, and to transmit my name to future
times; but thou&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am the daughter of a king!" said the countess,
haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"A king who is too far away to help you," said
Harold, with a mocking smile.
</p>

<p>
"But not too far away to avenge me!"
</p>

<p>
"Let him do so, if he will!" replied the barbarous
earl, as he grasped her wrists and dragged
her shrieking, and on her knees, towards the rocks
which overhung the stream.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she exclaimed, "my three helpless
daughters&mdash;your children&mdash;think of them with pity,
if not with pity for me!"
</p>

<p>
"My daughters&mdash;name them not," said he,
hoarsely, "lest I have them drowned in boiling
water, even as Halli and Leckner were in the days
of old!"
</p>

<p>
"I am not prepared to die!" she exclaimed in
a piercing voice; "my sins of omission are many;
oh, have mercy on me!"
</p>

<p>
"Thou art better prepared than I," said Morrar
na Shean.
</p>

<p>
"At least let me say one prayer in yonder
chapel ere you slay me&mdash;in pity for my sins and
soul, permit me this."
</p>

<p>
"Go, then," said Morrar, grimly; "but return
quickly, lest I drag you from its altar."
</p>

<p>
With tottering steps Gunhilda hurried into the
little chapel; but ere three minutes had elapsed,
the inexorable Morrar cried, sternly,&mdash;"Come
forth!"  There was no response.
</p>

<p>
"Come forth, Gunhilda, or by the Demon of the
Wends I will drag thee out!"
</p>

<p>
"I come&mdash;I come," replied a voice within the
vaulted oratory, from the arched windows of which
a sudden light gleamed forth.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," said Morrar, "for my patience is
nearly exhausted;" and the countess, with her
head bent, and muffled in her veil, approached him
from the arched doorway, through which a broad
and rosy flake of light was streaming.
</p>

<p>
Seizing her again by the arm, he dragged her to
the edge of the beetling rocks, where he meant to
stab and toss her into the eddying stream, which
was rushing in full flood towards the sea; but,
marvellous to relate! as he tore the veil asunder,
he beheld, not Gunhilda, but a strange woman
whose face was of wondrous beauty, and whose
head was encircled by a shining light.  Then he
knew in his heart that the spirit of St. Monina
stood before him!  The dagger fell from his hand;
he closed his eyes with awe and dismay, and when
he looked again the figure had melted into thin air
and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Appalled by this incident, he rushed away to the
wildest part of the hills, and on being joined by
Thorolf and John of Harpidale, he put to sea as
usual in his galley, and departed no one knew
whither.
</p>

<p>
The countess was found by her attendants in a
deep but soft slumber, before the little altar of the
river chapel; but immediately on her return to
Braal, she took her three daughters, Algiva, Erica,
and Thora, to Bishop Adam of Caithness, and
besought him to conceal and protect them; and
leaving them with tears and prayers, she returned
to the home of her terrible husband, giving out
that the children were dead.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the bishop, with all speed, despatched
them to the court of King William the Lion, and
consigned the three helpless girls to the care of the
Queen Ermengarde de Beaumont.
</p>

<p>
The vision he had beheld on that night by the
river Thurso long filled with terror the soul of
Morrar na Shean; but after a time the impression
became fainter, and gradually he came to the
conclusion that the whole affair must have been a
dream, originating most probably in his wine-cup.
</p>

<p>
He was long of returning to Braal, and solaced
himself by ravaging Heligoland and plundering
several of its towns, the sites of which have long
since been covered by the encroaching sea.  He
then visited Shetland, carrying havoc and dismay
wherever he appeared, and returning by Orkney,
committed a crowning act of impiety at Kirkwall.
There was preserved there a silver bowl, in which
St. Magnus had baptized the earliest Christians of
the Orcades.  It was of great size, curiously carved,
and was carefully preserved in the cathedral.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "It so far exceeds other bowls in size," says Buchanan, in
his "History of Scotland," "that it seems to be a relic of the
feasts of the LapithÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Accompanied by his two inseparable comrades
and mentors to mischief, he entered that stately
Gothic church, which is one of the finest in Scotland,
seized the great bowl, and filled it with wine, which
he solemnly consecrated to Odin.  Then, ascending
the steps of the High Altar, he quaffed it to the
dregs, after exclaiming,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I worship thee, Odin, and I am a heathen!  A
heathen will I die, if thou givest me but a son to
heir my lands, my isles, and to send down my name
to the days of other years."
</p>

<p>
For these proceedings they were all excommunicated
by the Bishop of Caithness, and while they
laughed to scorn the prelate and his solemn
anathema, they swore by the blades of their swords
and the shoulders of their horses (the old oath of
the northern pagans) to have a terrible revenge
upon him.
</p>

<p>
With this intention, after six years' absence, they
returned home, and again the great war-galley,
with all its purple sails spread, was seen to
stand round the rocky bluff named the Clett,
and come to anchor in Scrabster Roads, on the
western side of Thurso Bay.  On landing, the earl
repaired straight to the episcopal palace, with all
his followers, "to punish," as he said, "the bishop
with the serpent's tongue."  On seeing them
approach, the old man came forth to meet them;
and on beholding his serene and reverend aspect,
John of Harpidale, Thorolf Starkadder, and other
grim outlaws, were somewhat abashed and appalled,
and leaned irresolutely on their drawn swords.
</p>

<p>
"After a six years' absence, come you here, Lord
Harold, instead of visiting your lady at Braal?"
asked the bishop, with an air of surprise that was
not unmingled with alarm.
</p>

<p>
"The countess?&mdash;you speak not of my daughters."
</p>

<p>
"Alas! they are here no longer," said the bishop,
evasively.
</p>

<p>
"Dead?" asked the earl, with a cold smile.
</p>

<p>
"To you and all of us."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," said Harold, grinding his teeth;
"but I came not hither to speak of them!"
</p>

<p>
"Of what then?" asked Bishop Adam, with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Of thyself, who hast dared to pour empty
anathemas on me, for merely drinking a bowl of
wine in my own town of Kirkwall."
</p>

<p>
"Silence, thou blasphemous lord, who desecrated
the altar of God by the praises of a heathen idol!
I think of the coming time when thou shalt die!"
</p>

<p>
"And what then?" asked Morrar, with a fierce
and mocking laugh.
</p>

<p>
"In all thy vast possessions, who shall mourn
thee?"
</p>

<p>
"The greyhounds in my hall, and the birds of
prey, for whom I have prepared many a banquet:
yea, the black wolf and the yellow-footed eagle too
shall mourn for Morrar na Shean.  Priest, I have
come to punish your insolence.  Seize and drag him
forth, Thorolf Starkadder!"
</p>

<p>
In a moment the mailed hands of Thorolf were
wreathed in the white hair and reverend beard of
the old bishop, who was roughly dragged through
his own gate, and beaten to the earth beneath a
shower of blows dealt by clenched hands and the
heavy iron hilts of swords and daggers.
Breathlessly, and on his knees, he implored mercy,
beseeching them not to peril their souls by
murder, and a sin so foul as sacrilege, by imbruing
their hands in the blood of a priest; but the fury of
cruelty and destruction was in their hearts.  Thorolf,
with his dagger, destroyed the eyesight of the
poor old man; and John of Harpidale cut out his
tongue.
</p>

<p>
Then procuring the large cauldron in which food
was usually prepared for the staghounds of Morrar,
they actually cast the blind and bleeding bishop
into it, and boiled him alive.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The scene of this terrible outrage is still shown near the
Manse of Halkirk.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On hearing of these proceedings, the Countess
Grunhilda fled in horror to the cathedral of
Kirkwall, and took refuge with William Bishop of
Orkney, with whom she resided for several years,
while her daughters, under other names than their
own, were growing up to womanhood at the court
of Queen Ermengarde, and while her husband, the
Lord of the Venison, spent his days in hunting and
his nights in drinking, carousing, fighting, and
outrage, with his inseparable ruffians, John of
Harpidale and Thorolf Starkadder.
</p>

<p>
It was long before King William, who resided at
the palace of Scone, heard the correct details of
these outrages, and then his soul was filled with
sorrow and indignation, for he was a gentle, wise,
and valiant king.
</p>

<p>
He resolved to punish the wicked Earl of Caithness,
and for this purpose two earls, named Roland
and Gillechrist, were sent against him with a body
of troops.
</p>

<p>
Roland was the son of Uchtred, a brave lord of
Galloway, who had recently defeated the King of
England at Carlisle, when preparing to invade his
province; and he had become the husband of
Algiva, the eldest daughter of Morrar na Shean.
</p>

<p>
Gillechrist had wedded Erica, the second daughter.
He was Earl of Angus, and from this marriage are
descended the clan and surname of Ogilvie.  By a
singular coincidence these two peers were now
marching against their father-in-law, with orders to
subject him to the same death as that by which the
unhappy bishop died.
</p>

<p>
Morrar na Shean met them in a battle which was
long and bloody, though his people were cold in his
cause.  The men whom he had drawn from his
county of Orkney and the town of Thurso ultimately
gave way; and four hundred were instantly
hanged on the field.
</p>

<p>
The castle of Braal, to which the survivors fled,
was attacked, entered by the secret postern, and
stormed.  Therein, after a terrible conflict, were
taken John of Harpidale and Thorolf Starkadder,
who were put to dreadful deaths, and then the
fortress was burned to the ground.
</p>

<p>
It was supposed that Morrar na Shean had
perished in the flames; but he had escaped by the
postern&mdash;the same postern through which he had
led the countess to die&mdash;and reached his castle of
Lochmore, a secluded tower of great strength, which
is situated at the end of a loch, and overhangs the
current of the Dirlet out of it.  There the river is
narrow, deep, and rapid.
</p>

<p>
This tower was then remote and little known,
so there for years did Morrar live, secluded,
forgotten, and abandoned by all; and then, as time
crept on, he became a prey to remorse and horror.
</p>

<p>
Terrific visions and appalling spectres were said
to haunt him, and the unquiet souls of Thorolf, of
John of Harpidale, and others who had died in his
service, were averred to wander at night through
the silent chambers of Lochmore, and their wailing
voices were heard to rise from the lake in the
moonshine, and to mingle with the roar of the
Dirlet beneath the castle-wall.  At last no one
would remain in such a dwelling-place, and the
wretched Morrar na Shean was left entirely alone.
</p>

<p>
Then a sore illness came upon him with his growing
years; and sick, despairing, and sad at heart,
the earl lay on what he feared was his bed of
death.
</p>

<p>
None were near him now: even the last of his
hounds had gone to seek another, a merrier, or it
might be kinder master; and he wept the salt,
bitter tears of age, of sorrow, and repentance,&mdash;of
an age that was lonely and unfriended&mdash;of sorrow
for his lost wife and children&mdash;of repentance for a
wasted life, and for his many unatoned-for crimes
and sacrileges.
</p>

<p>
He found himself abandoned on earth, and feared
that he would be excluded from Heaven.  He was
wifeless, childless, friendless, and alone&mdash;alone
with only memory and the terrors of death and
superstition!
</p>

<p>
He saw the clear, bright stars in the northern
sky sparkling through the gloomy windows of
Lochmore.  He heard the hoarse brawl of the
Dirlet beneath the castle wall; but he shut out
the sound, for it made him think of that terrible
night when the swollen Thurso was rushing over its
stony bed, and Gunhilda was saved from his dagger
by the vision of St. Monina; and again he seemed
to see that pale, beautiful, and miraculous face
shining amid its halo, in the twilight before him.
</p>

<p>
The perspiration burst upon his wrinkled brow;
he called wildly for lights, but no one heard him
now; and the echoes of his own voice appalled him.
He trembled to be in the dark and alone; and yet
there was no darkness, for it was the clear twilight
of the northern summer, when the sun scarcely dips
beneath the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"Old, old! childless and alone!" moaned the
earl, crushed beneath the weight of sad thoughts
and unavailing sorrow, as he covered his grey head
beneath the coverlet, and sobbed heavily.
</p>

<p>
"Harold&mdash;husband," said a gentle voice, that
thrilled through him, and tremblingly he started and
looked up.
</p>

<p>
Lo! in the clear light of the midsummer night,
there stood by his bedside the Countess Gunhilda,
as he had last seen her, so fair and stately, with
her Danish tunic of blue silk, her flowing mantle,
and long lace veil, that fell over her shoulders from
under her half-diadem, the gems of which sparkled
in the light of the stars.
</p>

<p>
Beside her, but a little way behind, stood three
tall and handsome girls, each of whom wore riding-hoods
edged with pearls and long white veils, which
they held upraised, as they surveyed him with sad
and earnest eyes.
</p>

<p>
Believing that he saw but disembodied souls, the
upbraiding spirits of his wife and their three
daughters&mdash;for midsummer night is the time when
demons, ghosts, and fairies are all supposed to be
abroad,&mdash;the lonely earl uttered a cry of wild
despair and fainted.
</p>

<p>
Yet they were no spirits whom he had seen, but
the Countess Gunhilda and his three daughters,
who, having heard of his sad and repentant
condition, had hastened to visit and console him, and
arrived thus in the night.
</p>

<p>
And with Thora, the youngest and the fairest,
had come her husband&mdash;for she, too, was wedded
to William Sinclair, Lord of Roslin; and thus from
her descended the future Earls of Orkney, who were
also Dukes of Oldenburg.
</p>

<p>
On returning to consciousness Morrar na Shean
came to a new life of joy and happiness.  With
these came a more sincere repentance.  He spent
the remaining years of his life in endeavouring to
atone for the atrocities of his youth, and died at a
good old age when Alexander II. was King of
Scotland&mdash;passing peacefully away, while the faces
of his children and grandchildren were bowed in
prayer around him.
</p>

<p>
Such is the story of Morrar na Shean, the Lord
of the Venison.

<h3>
CHAPTER L.
<br><br>
THE RUINED HOUSE IN GLENSTRAE.
</h3>

<p>
After the conclusion of his tale, Rob gave the
harper a piece of Spanish gold, and permitted him
to pursue his own way.  The MacGregors saw him
no more; he was killed three years after, in the
September of 1722, when, by some of the
MacKenzies, a party of the king's troops under a
captain MacNeil were lured into an ambush, and so
severely handled that they were compelled to retire
to Inverness in great disorder.
</p>

<p>
The day after Gillian left them saw the MacGregors
traversing Glenstrae, a wild and romantic
valley which opens at the northern base of
Stronmiolchoin, a lonely mountain that forms the eastern
boundary of Glenorchy.
</p>

<p>
All these were possessions of which the clan had
been deprived; and there every hill and rock, every
thicket and ruin, was connected with some tradition
of the past and of Clan Alpine.
</p>

<p>
The glen was desolate and lonely; for it had long
since been swept of its people by the hostile tribes
who had leagued against them.
</p>

<p>
"Seid svas do piob, vich Alpine!" ("Strike up
your pipe, son of Alpine!") said Rob Roy, as they
approached a mass of ruined walls which rose on
a gentle eminence in the glen.  "Here, to-day, let
us remember the true and faithful dead, who
bequeathed to us the task of avenging them!"
</p>

<p>
Then in the still and silent valley the wild lament
of the MacGregors rang mournfully and shrill, as
Rob and his men, with their swords drawn, advanced
slowly to the ruins deisail-wise&mdash;by the way of the
sun's course,&mdash;and marched thrice round them,
and then departed, but with many a frowning glance
and backward look.
</p>

<p>
This was the ruined residence of the chief,
Alaster Roy of Glenstrae, before the clan had been
broken up and suppressed.  It had been destroyed
amid the events subsequent to the battle of
Glenfruin.  At the time of which we write a portion
of the walls were standing; now their foundations
can scarcely be discerned above the blooming
heather.
</p>

<p>
With these old ruins is connected a tradition of
the clan which exhibits some of the strongest traits
of the old Highland character.
</p>

<p>
Alaster Roy MacGregor of Glenstrae had but one
son, a brave and handsome youth, named Evan, to
whom he was deeply attached, and whom, as the
future heir of all his possessions, he trained up with
peculiar care, leaving nothing undone to make him
perfect as a soldier and huntsman.
</p>

<p>
One day when Evan was deerstalking among the
mountains he met the young Laird of Lamond, who,
with two attendants, was travelling from Cowal
towards the king's castle of Inverlochy, and they
dined together at a little inn or changehouse, near
the Blackmount at the mouth of Glencoe.
</p>

<p>
After dinner a dispute occurred; hot words
ensued, for both were passionate and fiery in spirit;
and, drawing his dirk, young Lamond killed Evan
MacGregor by a single blow, and he fell across the
table at which they had been seated.
</p>

<p>
Horrified at what he had done, Lamond leaped
from a window and fled, but was pursued by
Dugald Ciar Mhor and other MacGregors, who first
made short work with his two attendants.
</p>

<p>
The flight and pursuit were maintained on foot;
and with Lamond, who knew that he would be
instantly sacrificed if taken, fear added wings to his
speed, so that ultimately he outstripped the friends
of him he had slain.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of whither he went, as night was closing
he found himself in a lonely glen, where at the base
of a mountain stood a tower, at the gate of which
he breathlessly demanded shelter, succour, and rest.
</p>

<p>
On being admitted, he asked what place this was?
</p>

<p>
"Stronmiolchoin&mdash;the house of Glenstrae!"
replied the wondering gateward.
</p>

<p>
"The dwelling of Alaster Roy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then I am lost&mdash;utterly lost!" exclaimed
the unhappy Lamond, as he sank exhausted on
a seat.
</p>

<p>
"Lost! how&mdash;what mean you?" asked the
laird of Glenstrae, coming hurriedly forward.
"Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"The son of Lamond of that Ilk."
</p>

<p>
"By whom are you pursued, that my house
will fail to afford you succour?" asked Glenstrae.
</p>

<p>
"I am pursued by MacGregors," replied the
sinking fugitive, "and I beseech you, by all the
claims of hospitality and compassion, and by your
authority, to save me from them."
</p>

<p>
"You are safe," said Alaster, kissing the blade
of his dirk; "but what have you done&mdash;whom have
you slain?"
</p>

<p>
"Whom?" reiterated Lamond, in a hollow voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; there is blood upon your hands, and on
the hilt of your dirk."
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" said Lamond, and paused.
</p>

<p>
"Speak! for you are safe in the house of
Glenstrae, whatever you have done," said the chief
impetuously; but the unhappy fugitive clasped his
hands, for a din of voices rang at the tower gate,
and Dugald Ciar Mhor, with other pursuers, came
rushing in, bearing with them the body of Evan,
and after informing the unfortunate father of what
had occurred, they loudly demanded that the assassin
should be surrendered unto them.
</p>

<p>
"I have passed my word to protect him, and I
must respect it, even in this moment of agony!"
replied Glenstrae, while the tears rolled over his
face; "never shall it be said that a MacGregor
broke his word, even to an enemy!"
</p>

<p>
In their rage and sorrow for what had occurred,
his wife and daughter besought him to yield the
fugitive to the clansmen, that they might put him
to death; but Glenstrae stood over him with his
sword drawn, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Let no man here dare to lay a hand upon him!
MacGregor has promised him safety, and by the
soul of my only and beloved son, whom he has
slain, he shall be safe while under the roof of
Glenstrae&mdash;safe as if beneath his own!"
</p>

<p>
And before the interment of Evan, when the
sorrow and the angry passions of the assembled
clan would be roused to their full height, the chief,
with a chosen party, escorted young Lamond far
across the mountains, and almost to within sight of
his home in Cowal.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, Lamond," said he, gravely and
sternly; "on your own land you are now safe.
Farther I will not and cannot protect you.  Avoid
my people, lest your father may have to endure the
sorrow that wrings this heart of mine; and may
God forgive you the woe you have brought on the
house of Glenstrae!"
</p>

<p>
In a few years after this, the Field of Glenfruin
was fought; the castle of Stronmiolchoin was
destroyed, and Master of Glenstrae, then an aged
man, and all his people were proscribed fugitives.
</p>

<p>
Homeless, nameless, and a wanderer, with the
severe parliamentary acts of James VI. hanging
over his head, the laird of Glenstrae had to lurk in
the caves and woods among the glens that had
once been his own, till he was captured by
Sir James Campbell of Ardkinlass, from whom
ne made an escape, and fled to Cowal, a peninsula
of Argyle, that stretches far into the Firth
of Clyde.
</p>

<p>
Here the young laird of Lamond found the poor
old man, and received and protected him in his
house, with many other fugitives of the Clan Gregor,
saving them from Archibald Earl of Argyle and
other powerful enemies.
</p>

<p>
To the earl, Glenstrae at last yielded himself, on
the solemn promise that he should be sent out of
Scottish ground&mdash;a promise which was truly but
fearfully kept!
</p>

<p>
He was marched as far as the English side of
Berwick, under an escort of the Scottish Horse
Guard, commanded by David Murray, Lord Scone,
and then brought back to Edinburgh, where, with
eighteen devoted men of his surname, he was
hanged on the 20th of January, 1604.
</p>

<p>
"Being a chief," says Birrel, "he was hanged
his own height above the rest of his friends."
</p>

<p>
It was the memory of severities such as these,
together with their local position, that fostered a
spirit of resentment and ferocious resistance to all
civil law in the tribe of MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
"When I asked a very learned minister in the
Highlands," says Dr.  Johnson, "which he considered
the most savage clans, <i>those</i>, said he, <i>which
live next the Lowlands</i>."
</p>

<p>
This was the mere force of circumstances and
position; and hence the most warlike and predatory
of the Lowland clans were those of the borders
adjoining England.

<h3>
CHAPTER LI.
<br><br>
HE FIGHTS THE LAIRD OF BARRA.
</h3>

<p>
"Rob Roy had two especial qualities," says the
"New Picture of Scotland" (published in 1807):
"he spent his revenue generously, and was a true
friend to the widow and the orphan."
</p>

<p>
On his return to Portnellan, he now hoped
that, by the treasure which he had judiciously
distributed among his people, they might, if the
persecution of them ceased, stock their little farms
and take to cattle-dealing, that they might all
live in ease and comfort, and that his sons might
learn some of the arts of peace without forgetting
those of war.
</p>

<p>
Soon after his return from Glensheil, Rob heard
that Grahame of Killearn, who always treated the
tenantry of Montrose with great severity, had
sequestrated, or distrained, the cows and furniture
of a poor woman who lived near the Highland
border.
</p>

<p>
As she was a widow, and more especially as she
was the widow of Eoin Raibach, who had fallen at
the storming of Inversnaid, he immediately visited
her cottage, and she burst into tears when she
beheld him, exclaiming,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"MacGregor, <i>mo comraich ort</i>!" (my protection
is thee.)
</p>

<p>
"And never was that appeal made to me in vain
by the poor," replied Rob; "I shall be your buckler
and your sword of vengeance if requisite, widow.
How much do you owe Killearn?"
</p>

<p>
"Three hundred marks; for which he has seized
upon my two cows, the food of my children&mdash;my
spinning-wheel, which gives them clothing&mdash;our
beds and everything."
</p>

<p>
"When comes he here?" asked Rob, grimly.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow; to-morrow will see us desolate and
forlorn."
</p>

<p>
"Not so, widow.  Here are the three hundred
marks; pay the greedy vulture, and be sure that
you get a receipt duly signed."
</p>

<p>
Duly as the morrow came, the legal messengers
of Killearn arrived, with carts to convey away the
chattels of the widow, who paid them, and received
a receipt; but about a mile distant from her house,
they were met by Rob Roy, who, with a cocked
pistol in his hand, forced them to hand over the
money to him.  He then gave them a severe beating
with a heavy stick, advised them to choose
another trade than the law, and returned the three
hundred marks to the widow.
</p>

<p>
We are told that, under circumstances nearly
similar, he relieved a tenant on the Montrose lands
who was three years in arrear of rent.  When the
poor farmer offered to repay Rob's loan, the latter
replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No, no; I will get it back from Grahame
of Killearn&mdash;yes, every farthing, by Patrick of the
Holy Crook! so keep the money, farmer."
</p>

<p>
MacGregor now leased some pasture-lands further
among the mountains, in that place with which
his name is much associated, the braes of Balquhidder,
a name which signifies the dwelling-place
where five glens open.
</p>

<p>
He occupied the farmhouse of Inverlochluvig, at
the head of the braes, where there was excellent
pasture for black-cattle and sheep; and there was
born, in 1724, his youngest son, Robin Oig, whose
stirring story and sad fate created a deep interest in
future years.
</p>

<p>
Like all his brothers, young Robin was baptized
in water brought by Paul Crubach from the holy
well of St. Fillan; and during the ceremony was
held over his father's broadsword, for it was a
Highland superstition that the voices of children who
died without receiving this warlike consecration
were heard faintly wailing in the woods and other
lonely places at night.
</p>

<p>
Robin grew a sturdy but wild young Highlander;
and afterwards bore that sword with honour in the
ranks of the 42nd Regiment.
</p>

<p>
At Muirlaggan, in Balquhidder, Rob built a
comfortable house for his mother, then a very aged
woman; and he began to hope that the government
troops, the civil authorities, Athole, Montrose, and
Killearn, had forgotten him, and that he would be
permitted to spend a few years of his life in peace;
but he hoped in vain!
</p>

<p>
To the land he now leased or occupied in Balquhidder
he had an hereditary claim, as a descendant
of Dugald Ciar Mhor; but the MacLarens of
Invernentie had some similar right, and ere
long this proved the cause of much strife and
bloodshed.
</p>

<p>
With great generosity Rob offered a portion of
his share of the Spanish treasure to redeem another
bond which a neighbouring proprietor held over the
lands of his nephew, MacGregor of Glengyle.
</p>

<p>
Hamish MacLaren of Invernentie had lent a sum
of money to Glengyle, and by the tenor of the bond,
the lands so held, or named therein, "if the money
was not repaid within ten years, were to be <i>forfeited
to the lender</i>, though the sum was less than half
their value."
</p>

<p>
Knowing well that the utmost advantage would
be taken of this unjust contract, Rob Roy gave his
nephew money sufficient to repay Invernentie.
</p>

<p>
As the bond had but a few months now to run,
Glengyle, with gratitude and joy, hastened to his
creditor and offered the money so generously lent
by his uncle.
</p>

<p>
Hamish MacLaren was a man of rough and
forbidding exterior, with a low forehead and black
eyebrows that were thick, shaggy, and joined in
one.  His face was one of the lowest of the Celtic
type, and consequently expressed intense cunning,
falsehood, and cruelty.  He received Glengyle
coldly&mdash;all the more so, perhaps, because he was a near
kinsman of that MacLaren whom MacAleister had
flung into the millrace at Comar.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot take the money," said he, bluntly.
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;wherefore?" asked the other, with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Because I cannot find our bond."
</p>

<p>
"It must and shall be found!" said Glengyle,
impetuously.
</p>

<p>
"Must and <i>shall</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; there are but three months to run."
</p>

<p>
"Only three months?" repeated the other, with
affected surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;we have no time to lose."
</p>

<p>
"After the date at which the bond expires your
lands will be forfeited to me."
</p>

<p>
"How can you prove that if the bond be lost?"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha! it is recorded in the books of the
sheriff of the county.  My friend Killearn looked
to that."
</p>

<p>
"Here is your money&mdash;principal and interest,"
said Glengyle, crimsoned with fury; "bond or no
bond, take it and give me a receipt in full, or woe
unto you, Invernentie!"
</p>

<p>
But MacLaren was too wary either to accede or
to lose his temper.  By an exertion of cunning
and flattery, he contrived to cajole Glengyle,
who promised to wait until the actual bond could
be found; and for the three following months
MacLaren kept sedulously out of his way, avoiding
all visits, and receiving all messages and letters
with studied silence; and on the very day on
which the stated time expired, he took legal
means to get himself <i>infeft</i> in the lands which
he alleged to be forfeited.  At the same time,
through Grahame of Killearn, he served notices
upon young MacGregor to remove from these
lands, with his family, tenants, and cattle, within
eight days.
</p>

<p>
These proceedings were rendered darker by the
circumstance that Glengyle was labouring under a
severe illness, which made him totally incapable of
defending himself.
</p>

<p>
Rob Roy was filled with rage on hearing of these
lawless proceedings against his nephew; for to him
they seemed but a repetition of those severities to
which he had been subjected by Montrose.
</p>

<p>
"Greumoch," said he, "we cannot suffer Glengyle
to be treated thus; get our lads together, and
we shall teach Invernentie a lesson he is not likely
to forget."
</p>

<p>
The <i>lads</i> were soon collected, and at the head of
two hundred of them Rob marched into Strathfillan,
whither, he heard, MacLaren of Invernentie had gone
to attend a fair which is usually held there on the
3rd of July.
</p>

<p>
He traversed the vast extent of the fair&mdash;for the
strath was covered with great herds of cattle&mdash;searching
in vain for Invernentie, until he ascertained
that, having sold all his stock, he had taken
his way homeward through Glendochart.
</p>

<p>
In those days nothing was paid for pasturing
cattle; but as roads were made, fields inclosed, and
grass became valuable, the armed drovers were
forced to bargain for it in their routes to those fairs,
and more especially to Falkirk and Carlisle&mdash;innovations
which they bitterly hated.
</p>

<p>
A rapid march over the hills brought Rob and
his men upon the homeward path, at a point where
it is joined by the road from Tyndrum, some time
before Invernentie could possibly have passed.  Rob
was assured of this, and ere long he saw a party of
armed men, some of whom were mounted, coming
along that beautiful valley which the Dochart
traverses in its course to the Tay.
</p>

<p>
That the men on foot were well equipped was
evident, for the long barrels of their Spanish
muskets glittered in the sunshine, which streamed
athwart the winding valley, bathing in gold and
purple light the hills on one side, and casting into
deep-blue shadow those on the other.
</p>

<p>
The travellers, who were about twenty in number,
on seeing the MacGregors posted on the highway,
began to prepare for service, by loading their
muskets; the footmen unslung their targets; the
horsemen loosened their swords in the sheaths, and looked
to the priming of their pistols, as they all came
briskly up; and on Rob Roy stepping forward to
meet them, he found among the mounted men the
identical laird of Invernentie whom he sought,
with Campbell of Aberuchail, Stirling of Carden,
and another gentleman whom he did not recognize,
but who was followed closely by several well-armed
gillies on foot.
</p>

<p>
"What does this meeting bode, MacGregor?"
asked the baronet of Aberuchail; "peace or war?"
</p>

<p>
"That is as may be," replied Rob; "my present
business is with Hamish MacLaren of Invernentie."
</p>

<p>
The latter smiled grimly, and under his black
brows his keen, fierce, hazel eyes glared forth like
those of a polecat, as he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You must first speak with one who has travelled
a long way to see you, and who moreover is a friend
of mine."
</p>

<p>
"A bad recommendation; but to whom do you
refer?" asked MacGregor.
</p>

<p>
"He refers to <i>me</i>," said the strange traveller.
"I have indeed come a long way to see you,
MacGregor, and we meet most opportunely."
</p>

<p>
Rob surveyed the speaker with some surprise.
He was a man of great stature and apparent
strength, handsome, athletic, and in the prime of
life.  His sword, pistols, dirk, and powder-horn
were richly mounted with silver; he had three
feathers in his bonnet, indicating that he was a
chief; but MacGregor recognized neither his badge
nor his tartan.
</p>

<p>
"And who may you be, sir, that have been so
desirous to see me?" he asked, haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"I am Roderick MacNeil of Barra," replied the
other, on which Rob saluted him by uncovering his
head; for the MacNeils of Barra were an old family
in the Western Isles, famous for their antiquity&mdash;which
dated back to the days of the first Scottish
settlers&mdash;for their valour, and for their vanity: thus
one of them, named Rory the Turbulent, who lived
in the days of James VI., in the vastness of
his Highland bombast, had a herald who proclaimed,
in Gaelic, daily, from the summit of his
castle,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hear ye people, and listen all ye nations!
MacNeil of Barra having finished his dinner, all
the kings and princes of the earth have liberty to
dine."
</p>

<p>
The chief who now confronted Rob Roy was
considered one of the best swordsmen in Scotland;
and certainly he was the first in his native Hebrides.
He was possessed of a high spirit, with a romantic
love of adventure.  He had heard of Rob Roy's
skill in the use of his weapons and his renown in
arms; so he determined with his own hands to pub
his skill and valour to the test.
</p>

<p>
"And so," said he, while surveying him from
head to foot, "you are Rob Roy MacGregor, whom
I have so long wished to meet."
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose?" asked the other, haughtily;
"I never saw you before, MacNeil, and by your
bearing I care little if I never see you again."
</p>

<p>
"I have heard much of your fame, MacGregor,
and I have come hither&mdash;I, Roderick MacNeil of
Barra&mdash;to prove myself a better swordsman than you!"
</p>

<p>
At these words he leaped from his horse, tossed
the bridle to one of his gillies, and drew his sword
and dirk.
</p>

<p>
"Roderick MacNeil," said Rob, calmly, "I have
no doubt of your being what you assert&mdash;the Chief
of Barra, and of a noble and ancient lineage; a
better swordsman, and it may be a better man, than
I; but I have no wish to prove it.  My business is
with Invernentie here, and I never fight a man
without a reason.  With you I have no quarrel; so
keep your sword for the service of Scotland and her
king."
</p>

<p>
"I do so keep my sword; but you must
fight me, nevertheless," said the other, imperiously.
</p>

<p>
"Fie, sir!" replied Rob, whose temper was
rising; "this is a bad trade you have taken to."
</p>

<p>
"Trade?"
</p>

<p>
"Dioul, yes!&mdash;molesting honest people on the
open highway."
</p>

<p>
"Truly the taunt comes well from you&mdash;you, who
have kept the whole Highland border in hot water
since Dundee fell at Rin Ruari!"
</p>

<p>
On the face of MacLaren of Invernentie there
was a malicious smile, which compelled Rob to seem
calm; for he feared that if he fell in this impending
conflict, his nephew's interest would infallibly suffer
by the wiles and roguery of Invernentie and Killearn,
especially if aided by the bad influence of
Athole and Montrose.
</p>

<p>
"Barra," said he, "I never draw my sword
without a just cause of quarrel.  Go your way in
peace, and leave me to pursue mine."
</p>

<p>
Then Barra is recorded to have taunted him by
saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>You are afraid&mdash;your valour is in words.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"You shall have more than words," replied
MacGregor, furiously, as he unsheathed his sword.
"You have come a long way to see me, and shall
not go back without having done a portion of your
errand.  My hand is strong."
</p>

<p>
"And my sword sharp and sure."
</p>

<p>
"Neither sharper nor surer than mine, Barra,"
replied Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
"That we shall see, MacGregor Campbell."
</p>

<p>
"And deeply shall you feel," said Rob, more
than ever enraged at being named Campbell.
"Greumoch," he added, "stand by the side of
Invernentie, and if he attempts either escape or
foul play, slice him down with your axe.  And now,
Barra, have at you!"
</p>

<p>
While all who were on the pathway which traversed
the glen assembled in a large and excited
circle around them, the two combatants engaged
with great fury, and not a sound was heard but the
clash of their blades and their deep breathing.
Both were brave to the utmost, and both were
equally skilled in the use of their weapons; but
while sentiments of mere family pride and military
bravado animated Barra, MacGregor was inspired by
just indignation at being thus baited and molested
by a total stranger, and forced into an unexpected
duel, at a time so critical to the interests of his
household and his nephew, who by illness was
unable to protect himself.
</p>

<p>
Both were so exceedingly well matched in
strength and skill, that for more than twenty
minutes neither had in any way the advantage of
the other, till Barra made a feint, and then a fierce
thrust at Rob's bare throat; but he parried it by
a circular whirl of his claymore, which nearly
wrenched the other's weapon away.
</p>

<p>
During a second thrust Rob caught the blade of
Barra in the iron loops of his basket-hilt, but being
a younger man, the latter bounded agilely back,
and released his sword in time to save it, ere
Rob could snap the blade, or lock in and use
his dirk.
</p>

<p>
After a time Barra's sword shook in his hand and
bent&mdash;it was soon full of deep notches; and fatigue
rendered his arm weary,  He was compelled to give
ground step by step, till at last MacGregor tossed
aside his shield, and throwing all his strength into
one tremendous double-handed stroke, beat down
his guard, snapped his blade like a withered
reed, and gave him a wound so severe that
he "nearly cut off his sword-arm, which
confined him to the village of Killearn for three
months."
</p>

<p>
"When next we meet," cried Barra, as he fell
into the arms of Stirling of Carden, "our parting
shall be different!"
</p>

<p>
But, fortunately, they never chanced to meet again.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LII.
<br><br>
INVERNENTIE PUNISHED.
</h3>

<p>
Great was the exultation of the MacGregors, and
with wild halloos of triumph they crowded about
their leader, who, with his characteristic generosity,
was one of the first to proffer assistance to the
wounded chief.
</p>

<p>
As the parties separated, Invernentie was whipping
up his Highland garron, preparatory to taking
a speedy leave, when Greumoch inserted the hook
of his Lochaber axe in the collar of his coat, and
roughly tumbled him on the roadway.
</p>

<p>
Enraged by such treatment, MacLaren drew his
dirk, and was rushing on his captor, when the latter
charged the pikehead of the axe full at his breast,
and would have killed him without mercy, but
for the interference of Campbell of Aberuchail
and Rob Roy, who desired his followers to seize
and convey him to a small inn which stood at
the head of the strath; and there, as night was
closing, MacLaren found himself abandoned by his
companions, helpless, and a prisoner of the easily
exasperated MacGregors, all somewhat excitable
Celts,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose patience<br>
  Was apt to wear out on trifling occasions.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Hamish MacLaren, a dark, fierce, and resolute
fellow, asked Rob Roy, sternly, "for what purpose
he had been separated from his friends, disarmed,
and brought as a prisoner to this solitary
house?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, in the first place," said Rob, calmly,
"I wish to speak with you; and, in the second
place, to punish you if you do not take my
advice."
</p>

<p>
"In what matter&mdash;dioul!&mdash;in what matter?"
demanded MacLaren, knitting his black brows
till his gleaming eyes were almost hidden by
them.
</p>

<p>
"The matter of the bond&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Which I hold over the lands of Grahame
of Glengyle?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I know nothing of <i>that</i> document,"
replied Rob, twirling one of his pistols ominously
round his forefinger by the trigger guard.
</p>

<p>
"Then to what do you refer?"
</p>

<p>
"To the bond which you allege to hold over the
lands of my sick nephew, Gregor <i>MacGregor</i> of
Glengyle."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;well?"
</p>

<p>
"Hamish MacLaren of Invernentie," said Rob,
making a great effort to appear calm, "I have here
the money to release this bond."
</p>

<p>
"But I decline it&mdash;the time has expired," said
MacLaren, doggedly.
</p>

<p>
"It may have expired <i>now</i>," said Rob Roy;
"but it had not expired when, more than three
months ago, Glengyle offered you the money,
principal and interest."
</p>

<p>
"I told him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A falsehood&mdash;a black lie, Invernentie!  You
told him the bond was lost, when it was, and still
is, in your charter-box; and now I swear, by the
Grey Stone of MacGregor, that until you produce
that bond, we part not company, in life at least!"
</p>

<p>
MacLaren's breast swelled with rage and spite.
His face grew ashy white, and the veins of his
forehead were swollen like whipcord, with the
baffled avarice and passion he strove in vain to
conceal.
</p>

<p>
"Allow me to return to Invernentie," said he, in
a husky voice and with averted eyes, "and I shall
send hither the bond, if I can find it."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, we part not company until it is produced
<i>here</i>; and if that fails to be done, you shall go
back to Invernentie heels foremost."
</p>

<p>
"How mean you?"
</p>

<p>
"In your coffin," replied MacGregor, with a dark
and terrible frown.
</p>

<p>
Aware that he had to deal with one who did not
stand on trifles, MacLaren, apprehensive for the
result, agreed that two of his servants (who had
ventured to the inn), accompanied by Coll and
Greumoch, should go to the house of Invernentie
and get the bond, while he remained as Rob's
hostage in Strathfillan.
</p>

<p>
They were absent some time, as Invernentie
(which means the conflux of dark waters) was
several miles distant; but on the evening of the
second day they returned with the bond, and placed
it in the hands of MacLaren, who, without opening
it, tossed it across the table to Rob Roy, saying,
sullenly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here is your precious document, and now let
me begone."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite so fast&mdash;tarry, I pray you," said
Rob, as he read over the paper, examined it in
every particular, tore it into minute fragments,
and scattered them over the clay floor of the
room.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he added, "here is the money of Glengyle."
</p>

<p>
"I shall record the discharge of the debt in the
books of the sheriff," said MacLaren, rising and
putting on his bonnet.
</p>

<p>
"You and the sheriff may do exactly as you
please," said Rob; "in fact you have my full permission
to hang yourselves, if it suits your fancy; but,
in the meantime, give me a discharge in full for the
money which you lent my nephew, Gregor <i>MacGregor</i>
of Glengyle."
</p>

<p>
Invernentie, who had some other roguish scheme
in his head, most unwillingly wrote and signed the
required quittance, which Rob carefully read,
folded, and put in his pocket, together <i>with
the bag of money</i>, telling him that now he would
not pay him a farthing&mdash;"that the sum lost
was too small a fine for the outrage he had
attempted to perpetrate in form of law, and that
he might be thankful that he escaped with a
sound skin."
</p>

<p>
They separated.  MacLaren was choking with
resentment, and vowed to have a terrible revenge;
but Rob and his men merely laughed at him, as
they marched off towards their new home on the
braes of Balquhidder.

<h3>
CHAPTER LIII.
<br><br>
ATTACKED BY THE DUKE OF ATHOLE.
</h3>

<p>
Rob having retired further north-west, was living
in comparative peace and ease at Balquhidder,
though ever armed, watchful, and on the alert; but
now his old and wanton enemy, the Duke of
Athole&mdash;an enemy despite the cavalier sentiments of
Tullibardine and his other sons, and the sympathies of
the gentle Duchess Katherine&mdash;during the middle
of 1724, made no less than <i>three</i> vigorous attempts
to capture him, for he was still outlawed, and the
warrants for his apprehension were yet in full force
against him, with ample rewards for those who
could achieve this hitherto perilous and difficult
task.  Of Athole's final attempts we shall briefly
relate the success.
</p>

<p>
In retaliation for the trick so basely played him
at the castle of Blair, Rob had certainly more than
once ravaged the estates of the Duke of Athole,
carried off the cattle, and put to the sword several
Drummonds who resisted.
</p>

<p>
Though he had drawn these reprisals on himself,
Athole could as little forgive such proceedings
as his Grace of Montrose; and on his return from a
visit to London he secretly despatched a party of
Lord Polworth's Light Horse up the glens to
Balquhidder, at a time when most of the MacGregors
were absent at fairs, or on the mountains
herding cattle.
</p>

<p>
MacLaren of Invernentie is said to have given
them exact information of Rob's movements, for
they came upon him most unexpectedly, during a
fine summer evening when he was superintending a
few of his people, who were cutting turf with the
<i>ceaba</i>, a long, narrow spade of peculiar form, used
by the Highlanders and Irish.  Suddenly there was
a cry of&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The Redcoats! the Redcoats!" and the
women threw down their keallochs, or creels, as
a party of troopers, on light active horses, dashed
round the shoulder of a rocky ridge, and came
pellmell among them, with swords flashing in the
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Rob had only three men with him, and save their
dirks, each was armed only with a turf-spade.
While he swung one of these implements aloft, to
use it like a poleaxe, resolved on making a desperate
defence, its shaft was shattered in his hand, as
a trooper adroitly broke it by a pistol-shot, and
then spurred his horse right over him.
</p>

<p>
Rob lost his dirk, but plunged his skene-dhu
deep into the bowels of the animal, which reared
wildly and threw his rider head downward into the
soft bog, where his spurred jack-boots stood
upper-most in the air.
</p>

<p>
Beaten down again under a shower of
sword-blades and clubbed carbines, MacGregor was made
prisoner.  He was then mounted on a horse and
carried off, amid the yells, screams, and
lamentations of the women.  He was threatened with
instant death if he attempted to resist or escape;
and, fortunately, on this occasion, they were
without a rope to bind him; but the officer in
command, an Irish captain, held a cocked pistol
in his right hand, and rode by the side of the
prisoner.
</p>

<p>
"Remember," said he, "that your <i>head</i> may be
more easily carried than your body, if you prove
troublesome.  Forward&mdash;away for Stirling&mdash;away
at full speed!" were the orders; and the Light
Horse disappeared with MacGregor, while the turf-cutters
flew to arms and to muster others for rescue
and revenge.
</p>

<p>
This, however, was unnecessary; for, when passing
through a glen or ravine which lies between the
church of Balquhidder and Glendochart, at a place
where, on the side of the former, the ground is
steep and rugged, but on the latter has a long
and gradual slope towards the Dochart, Rob
suddenly wrenched away the Irishman's pistol, which
exploded in the air, and slipping over his horse's
crupper, sprang up the rocks, where not a single
trooper could follow him.
</p>

<p>
Enraged by the sudden escape of his prisoner,
the officer spurred his horse till the steel rowels
tore the flesh; it bounded madly upward against
the rocks, and fell back upon its haunches,
half-stunning its rider; and to this day the place bears
the name of <i>Shiam an Erinich</i>, or the "Irishman's
Leap."
</p>

<p>
A few days after this, Rob escaped again by mere
coolness and presence of mind, when in Glenalmond
he encountered the same party of Polworth's Light
Horse, who instantly knew and greeted him with
a shout; while some drew their swords, others
loaded their carbines, and all spurred their horses
on.  Rob was quite alone; he had been separated
from his eldest son and followers, with twenty of
whom he had been purchasing cattle at a
neighbouring fair.
</p>

<p>
No succour was near.  The place of this <i>rencontre</i>
is a savage and solitary pass, overlooked by hills
about fourteen hundred feet in height, the steep
sides being pressed so close together as barely to
leave space at the bottom for a narrow path and
the brawling river's bed.  On their sides some
meagre shrubs sprout from the fissured rocks,
beneath the shadow of which the Almond looks
sombre, dark, and inky, save when churned into
brown foam, as it thunders over a linn, or chafes on
the obstructing boulders.
</p>

<p>
At the upper end of this lonely pass stands a
grey and time-worn block of stone, eight feet in
height, which marks the grave of the Scottish
Homer&mdash;Ossian, the son of Fingal.
</p>

<p>
In the wildest and narrowest path of this
mountain gorge, Rob suddenly found himself confronted,
about nightfall, by the same Irish captain and his
party of horse.  In an angle of the narrow way,
where an overhanging rock protected him on one
side and the deep river's bed on the other, he stood
facing them, sword in hand, and covered by his
round shield; thus the troopers could see nothing
beyond him.
</p>

<p>
As only one at a time could attack him, the
leading trooper was somewhat impressed by the
resolute expression of his well-bearded face, his
stature, and firm posture of defence.
</p>

<p>
"I know whom you seek," said he, sternly;
"but I swear that if you do not instantly depart,
not one of you shall return alive!  In less than
half an hour my men will have possession of the
bridge of Buchanty, and your retreat will be
cut off."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this, the soldiers began to rein back
their horses.
</p>

<p>
"Retire in time," resumed MacGregor, "and
tell him who sent you that, if any more of his pigmy
race come hither, by the bones of our dead, I will
hang them up to feed the eagles!"
</p>

<p>
He then placed his horn to his mouth and blew
a loud and ringing blast, to which hill and river
echoed.
</p>

<p>
On this, believing that the whole clan were
concealed among the rocks, from, whence a fire
would be opened upon them, the troopers seized
by a panic, wheeled round their horses and retired
at full gallop, while Rob ascended the cliffs, and
leisurely pursued his way in another direction.
</p>

<p>
The government, in despair perhaps, were now
ceasing to molest Rob Roy, and the last time troops
were sent against him was the sudden despatch of
a strong force of infantry from the castle of Stirling,
under Colonel Grahame.
</p>

<p>
This party were seen on their march to Callendar
by some MacGregors, who were driving a herd of
cattle along the banks of the Forth, so Rob was
immediately apprised of the unwelcome visitors.
In an hour, the whole fighting men of the braes of
Balquhidder were in arms, and had scouts posted at
every pass and avenue; but as Rob had no wish to
subject his people to severity on his own account&mdash;for
it was <i>he</i> alone whom Grahame had orders to
capture&mdash;he retired further off into the mountains,
a precaution he would not have adopted in his
younger and more fiery years.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers met with every opposition, and
frequently with bloody resistance from the
MacGregors; and they had a four days' fruitless search,
toiling, with knapsacks and accoutrements, cocked
hats, pipe-clayed breeches, and long gaiters, up
steep mountains, down ravines, where they
floundered, and sunk knee-deep among wet heather,
fern, and rushes; stumbling over precipices, and
always misled by the guides, who took the bribes
of the officers, and then vanished into the mist
or a thicket, leaving them to shift for themselves,
till the evening of the fourth day found Colonel
Grahame and his detachment, starving, weary, and
worn, occupying a deserted house on the verge of
the Lowlands, near the hills of Buchanan.
</p>

<p>
The rain was falling in torrents, and no sentinels
were posted without; so there Rob came upon them
in the night, and, by throwing in combustibles, set
the house on fire about their ears.
</p>

<p>
This immediately dislodged the enemy.  As they
rushed forth in disorder and dismay, many were
severely injured by bruises and by the explosion of
the ammunition in their pouches.  Many lost their
weapons, and "one man was killed by the
accidental discharge of a musket.  The military, thus
thrown into confusion, broken down by fatigue,
and almost famished by want of provisions,
withdrew from the country of the MacGregors, happy
that they had escaped so well."
</p>

<p>
This was&mdash;as we have stated&mdash;the <i>last</i> encounter
of Rob Roy with the forces of the government.

<h3>
CHAPTER LIV.
<br><br>
THE FINAL ATTEMPT OF ATHOLE.
</h3>

<p>
It was the Lammas now of 1724, when the gool or
wild marigold began to make its appearance among
the little corn patches on the sunny side of the
Highland hills; and in this month the mother of
Rob Roy (a daughter of the house of Glenfalloch),
then in extreme old age, being nearly a century
old, expired at Muirlaggan, the house which he had
built for her.
</p>

<p>
Though her passing away had been long expected,
her death was accompanied by the omens and
mysterious warnings then and still so universally
believed in among the Highlanders.  Rob's grey
staghounds howled mournfully the livelong night, a
sure sign that they had seen what the eyes of men
could not&mdash;the shadow of Death enter the house of
Muirlaggan; and Paul Crubach, now aged, half-blind,
and bent with years, averred that on last
Midsummer-eve he had beheld her figure pass
before him into the churchyard of Balquhidder with
a shroud <i>high</i> upon her breast, a certain token that
her death was close at hand.
</p>

<p>
On the day preceding the funeral, and before the
clan, tenants, and gillies assembled to drink the
dredgie, he came close to the chair of Rob, who
was seated at window, full of thought.
</p>

<p>
"Paul, you have been absent some days,"
said Rob kindly to the old man, "and at your
years&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have been on Inchcailloch, and there I spent
three nights," said he, with unusual solemnity.
</p>

<p>
"Three dreary nights they must have been,"
said Rob, with a sad smile; "a ruined church for
shelter and the graves of the dead below you."
</p>

<p>
"But I slept thereon, knowing that the dead
would give me counsel just and true; and in my
dreams there appeared unto me twice one whom I
knew to be Dugald Ciar Mhor."
</p>

<p>
"How knew you this?"
</p>

<p>
"By his mouse-coloured hair and beard, and he
told me&mdash;told me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;what?" asked Rob, impatiently;
"oh, Paul&mdash;Paul&mdash;Dugald lies in his grave in
Glenlyon."
</p>

<p>
"It matters not&mdash;he told us to <i>beware of
Athole</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Paul, is not this mockery, and at such a time?
Beware of Athole?  We have done little else for
these twenty years past."
</p>

<p>
"Above the graves of the dead we get counsel
just and true," repeated poor, old, half-witted Paul,
ignorant that, sixteen centuries before, Pomponius
Mela recorded a similar idea.
</p>

<p>
The escapes of Rob had been so numerous and
so desperate that they became a byeword&mdash;a joke
in the Highlands, where the people were wont to
say,&mdash;"You might as well attempt to say MacNab
thrice with your mouth shut as attempt to catch
Rob Roy;" and believing himself to be singularly
favoured by fortune in that matter, he paid but
little attention to the warning of Paul till about
sunset, when his son Ronald came running in
bareheaded and breathless from a cattle-fold to
announce that a party of soldiers were rapidly
approaching the house!
</p>

<p>
The natural grief which Rob was enduring for
the death of his mother turned into exasperation.
He now kept fewer men about him than had been
his wont in other times, and it chanced that, though
some hundreds would muster for the funeral on
the morrow, there were not ten in the house at this
desperate crisis!
</p>

<p>
He buckled on his sword, thrust his loaded pistols
in his belt, threw his target on his arm, kissed
Helen and the babe Robin at her breast, and
was rushing from the house to seek shelter on
the hills, when the Duke of Athole, with two
hundred and fifty of his tenantry, all mounted
and armed with sword, pistol, and musketoon,
drew up before the door.
</p>

<p>
Keeping his hand on his sword, Rob saluted the
duke, saying, with that suave irony which a
Highlander can so well assume,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am obliged to your grace for coming unasked
with such a goodly company to attend my mother's
funeral.  Glenfalloch and Breadalbane will alike
deem it an honour which neither they nor I
expected."
</p>

<p>
"I have not come here for any such purpose,"
replied Athole, haughtily, as he shook the long
curls of his peruke, and kept his horse well in hand,
while keenly eyeing every motion of MacGregor.
"I have come but to crave the pleasure of your
company so far as the Tolbooth of Perth, where we
shall settle some old scores at leisure."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said Rob, sternly.  "Had I received
sufficient notice of your grace's visit, we had met at
the pass of Loch Ard, not at my own door, and I
should have resorted to other means than temporising.
Within that chamber, duke, lies my mother
in her coffin&mdash;a woman old in years&mdash;yea, so old
that she remembered the earliest days of Charles I.,
to whom your grandsire, Earl John of Athole, was
a steadfast man mid true; so, should I die for it
here upon the threshold, I shall neither yield nor go
to Forth your prisoner; for now in death, as in life,
my place shall be by my mother's side!"
</p>

<p>
"Enough of this," said Athole, coarsely; "the
funeral may go on very well without you."
</p>

<p>
Taken at vantage, however, Rob gradually perceived
that he could gain nothing by resistance;
and, as the duke dismounted, and stood by the
bridle of his horse, he affected to comply with his
wish.  Then shrill screams and cries of lamentation
rose from the women of the tribe, great numbers of
whom had already assembled at Muirlaggan; and
within the doorway of the house were seen the dark
and scowling faces of men, with the gleam of arms,
as swords and skenes were drawn and muskets
loaded; for there Greumoch, Alaster Roy, and Rob's
sons, Coll, Duncan, Hamish, and Ronald, prepared,
like brave youths, to defend or die beside him.
</p>

<p>
A babel of hoarse and guttural Gaelic tongues
rang on all sides, and many of the duke's yeomanry
had unsheathed their swords and unslung their
musketoons preparatory to carrying off the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
The voices of his sons, the lamentations of the
women, thoughts of Helen with the babe at her
breast, and his mother lying dead in her coffin,
filled MacGregor's soul with desperation.  Thrusting
aside by main strength of arm half a dozen of the
troopers who had begirt him, he drew forth his
claymore, and called upon them all to stand
back&mdash;back, upon their lives!
</p>

<p>
On this, snatching a pistol from his holsters, Athole
fired it full at the head of Rob, who at the same
moment fell to the ground.  He had only slipped a
foot, but on seeing him fall a mingled yell pierced
the welkin, and before the smoke had cleared away,
the duke found himself in the grasp of a woman.
</p>

<p>
This was a sister of Rob, who had married her
cousin Glenfalloch.  A strong and active woman,
of a fiery and affectionate temper, on seeing
her brother fall, she believed he was killed, and
making a furious spring at Athole, clutched his
throat with such energy that his grace was soon
speechless.  He reeled and staggered, while his
followers, none of whom dared to use their pistol-butts
or clenched hands to a lady, were unable to
release him, till Rob seized his sister's wrist, and
rescued him.  On this the lady fainted.
</p>

<p>
This strange and unseemly scuffle fortunately
caused some delay.  For a time the duke was unable
to mount his horse; and ere he did so, the mustering
MacGregors, summoned by Greumoch, Paul, and
the shrieking women, from farm and clachan, came
pouring in with brandished swords and axes in such
numbers that Colonel Grahame, who was present,
deeming discretion the better part of valour, seized
the duke's horse by the bridle, and gave the order
to retire as fast as possible.
</p>

<p>
Rob permitted Athole to do so unmolested, and
now, for a time, the house of Muirlaggan, where the
dead woman lay, presented that which was not
uncommon then in the Highlands in cases of either
sorrow or joy, a scene of fearful wrath and noisy
uproar.
</p>

<p>
Had Athole come next day, he might have
experienced a warmer reception; for when Glengyle
came in, more than seven hundred armed men, with
twenty pipers, attended the funeral, and thus the
old lady was born to her long home by her four
grandsons; for in the Highlands it was ever a boy's
pride, and one of the tests of manhood, to be
permitted to act as bearer of a coffin, perhaps for many
miles over steep and rugged mountain-paths.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion, Paul Crubach stumbled and fell
on his face as the funeral procession approached the
church of Balquhidder, <i>deisail</i>-wise, and then the old
superstition was whispered, that he who stumbled
at a burial was certain to be the <i>next</i> whose coffin
would be borne that way; and this was fully
realized when poor old Paul was found dead in bed
next morning.
</p>

<p>
The duke never again had an opportunity of
molesting Rob Roy, as on the 14th November of
this year his grace paid the debt of nature at his
castle of Blair, in Athole.

<h3>
CHAPTER LV
<br><br>
ROB ROY IN LONDON.
</h3>

<p>
From this time forward the life of the Red
MacGregor was passed in ease and contentment; around
him his sons grew to manhood, brave, active, and
hardy; while the sons of those who had followed
him to the battles of Sheriffmuir and Glensheil, to
the storming of Inversnaid, the pass of Loch Ard,
and to many a desperate conflict, became, under
his care and advice, thriving cattle-dealers and
industrious farmers.  Yet neither he nor they were
permitted entirely to let their swords rest, or forget
the warlike lessons of their forefathers, for the
battle of Culloden had not yet been fought, and in
disposition and character the secluded Highland
clans were little different from what their ancestors
were when they routed the Romans on the Grampians,
and hemmed them within the wall of Agricola&mdash;as
their songs have it, "forcing the King of
the World to retire beyond his <i>gathered heaps</i>."
</p>

<p>
In 1727, George II. was crowned, and six months
after it was known in the Highlands that another
"stranger filled the Stuarts' throne," and perhaps
as many years elapsed before it was known in some
of the Scottish isles, so dilatory was the transmission
of news in the last century.
</p>

<p>
Even Montrose had now ceased to molest Rob
Roy, who in his prosperity no longer "drew his
grace's rents," but, extending his possessions
beyond Balquhidder, leased some mountain-farms
from the Duke of Argyle.  On learning this, Montrose,
in whose breast the old emotion of animosity
still rankled, before the Lords of the Privy Council
in London, accused his grace, who was the famous
Field-Marshal John Duke of Argyle and Greenwich,
of "fostering and protecting an outlaw."
</p>

<p>
"I do neither," replied he, angrily; "I only
supply Rob Roy with the wood of the forest, the
fish of the stream, the grass of the glen, and the
deer of the hill&mdash;the common heritage of all
Highlanders.  But you have afforded him cattle, corn,
and meal; moreover, we are informed that he is
your grace's factor, and that on more than one
occasion he has collected your rents, especially at
Chapelerroch."
</p>

<p>
Montrose, who felt the taunt implied his own
inability to defend himself, bit his lip in angry
silence.
</p>

<p>
About this time Rob would seem to have visited
England.
</p>

<p>
It is also said that he went so far south as
London, as a <i>protÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©</i> of the Duke of Argyle, who
was then in the zenith of his military and political
influence.  The story adds, that the duke requested
Rob, in his full Highland dress and arms, to
promenade for some time before St. James's Palace,
where the attention of George II. was drawn to
him&mdash;his garb being somewhat unusual in such a
locality, and more especially in those days.
</p>

<p>
Some time after, when Argyle attended a royal
levee, the king observed that he had "lately seen
a handsome Scots Highlander near the palace."
</p>

<p>
"He was Robert MacGregor," replied the duke;
"the identical outlaw who has long kept the Highlands
of Perthshire in a turmoil by his resistance
and resentments."
</p>

<p>
At this reply the king was very much incensed;
but be the story as it may, there appeared in
London, about this time, a pretended memoir of
Rob, under the flattering title of <i>The Highland
Rogue</i>.  "It is," says the groat novelist, "a
catch-penny publication, bearing in front the effigy of a
species of ogre, with a beard a foot long, and
therein his actions are as much exaggerated as his
personal appearance."
</p>

<p>
It was during his absence in the south that Helen
MacGregor enacted the only bold and masculine
part she is known to have played on the stage of
real life.
</p>

<p>
The proprietor of Achenriach, near the clachan
of Campsie, having refused to pay his arrears of
black-mail, Helen, as her two eldest sons were
absent, being lieutenants in the Highland Watch
under Glune Dhu, mounted on horseback, with a
pair of loaded pistols at her saddlebow, and attended
by Greumoch and twelve tall gillies fully armed,
with targets on their backs and long muskets sloped
on their shoulders, crossed the Campsie Fells, and
presenting herself at the gate of Achenriach,
demanded of the laird the tax which was due to her
absent husband.
</p>

<p>
He speedily came forth with the money, saying,
"Madam, I can refuse a lady nothing&mdash;neither
would I have the hardihood to oppose you."
</p>

<p>
In this district Rob's nephew levied black-mail
till within little more than a hundred years ago.

CHAPTER LVI.
<br><br>
THE DUELS WITH INVERNAHYLE AND ARDSHEIL.
</h3>

<p>
As time stole on and ripening age wrinkled the
brow and whitened the beard of Rob Roy, he lived
a quiet and inoffensive life.  A change came
gradually over him.  Time with its mellowing influences
rendered him less fierce, less irritable, and in the
events that marked the close of his career he showed
less inclination to meet half-way those who would
seek a quarrel with him.
</p>

<p>
In the winter of 1727, while purchasing some
cattle at the fair of Doune, he obtained among
others a cow from a woman who offered it for sale.
</p>

<p>
On the following Sunday he happened to attend
the parish church.  The sermon of the minister
was directed against the sin of covetousness, fraud,
and roguery; and his text was the Eighth
Commandment.
</p>

<p>
Emphatically and amply did the divine expatiate
upon his subject; and with his eyes fixed resolutely
on MacGregor, threw out so many offensive hints,
which were evidently meant for <i>him</i>, that Rob soon
found himself the centre of observation; and his
heart swelled with rage, while he could not but
admire the daring of the man who thus bearded
one who might have fired both church and manse
about his ears.
</p>

<p>
However, smothering his wrath, Rob waited
quietly until the sermon was over and the
congregation had dispersed.  He then repaired to the
manse, and requested to see the minister, who met
him with a calm and unflinching front.
</p>

<p>
"Reverend sir," said he, "I was present, as you
no doubt perceived, at sermon this morning, and
heard your discourse, every word of which I
understood, but should like to know what you <i>meant</i> by
it.  I am an old man now, and have lived a bold
and perilous life, but I shall thank you to point out
a single instance of fraud or roguery that has
dishonoured it.  If you cannot, as you have made me
a spectacle to your parishioners, by the souls of
those who died in Glenfruin!  I will compel you to
retract your words in your own pulpit."
</p>

<p>
Unmoved by the stern bearing of Rob, whose
right hand clutched his dirk, the minister replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I own, MacGregor, that I alluded to you."
</p>

<p>
"Dioul, to me!" exclaimed Rob, furiously.
</p>

<p>
"To you.  Did you not buy a cow from a poor
widow at the fair of Doune&mdash;a cow at little more
than half its value?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I was ignorant that she was poor, that
she was a widow, and considered her cow worth
double what she asked for it; but is my whole
life to be slandered thus, and about a miserable
cow?"
</p>

<p>
"Her family are starving&mdash;that cow was the last
of her herd, for the others all died of disease."
</p>

<p>
"If this be the case," said Rob, "I shall restore
to her the cow with double the sum I paid for it;
here," he added, laying the bank-notes on the
table, "I leave the money with your reverence.  I
shall do more; she shall have eight cows, the best
in my herd, and money to stock her farm anew, for
never shall it be said that a widow appealed in vain
to the sympathy of Rob Roy!"
</p>

<p>
After this time he passed nearly seven years in
perfect peace; but in 1734 he became embroiled
with a very powerful enemy, Stewart of Appin.
</p>

<p>
The clan of MacLaren laid claim to the land of
Invernentie in Balquhidder; to this the MacGregors
also had a right, which they enforced by the blades
of their swords, expelling therefrom Hamish
MacLaren.  A portion of Balquhidder was certainly the
ancient patrimony of the Clan Laren, and their
feud with the MacGregors was embittered by the
memory that the latter, in 1604, had slain <i>forty-six</i>
of their householders, with all their wives and
children, as the criminal record has it.
</p>

<p>
In 1734, they appealed to Appin, chief of the
Stewarts, a powerful tribe, which could always
muster from seven to eight hundred swordsmen.
General Stewart of Garth, so lately as 1821,
reckoned the fighting force of this name at four
thousand men.
</p>

<p>
The MacLarens assembled in great numbers;
Appin reinforced them with four hundred chosen
men, and together they marched into Balquhidder,
where Rob Roy with all his kindred was in arms to
oppose them.
</p>

<p>
The summer sun shone brightly on the grey walls
of the old kirk of Balquhidder, shaded by its dark
yew-trees, and its quaint old burial-ground studded
with mossy head-stones, when close by it the hostile
clans approached each other in two lines, each
man with his round shield braced upon his left arm,
and his sword brandished in his right hand.
</p>

<p>
All the Stewarts had thistles in their bonnets;
the MacLarens had laurel leaves, and their war-cry,
"Craig Tuirc!  Craig Tuirc!" was shouted fiercely
by a hundred tongues, for they were eager to
engage.
</p>

<p>
Conspicuous in front of the MacGregors stood
Rob Roy, in his waving tartans; his once ruddy
beard was now white with time, but his strong
form was erect as ever.  Anxious to avoid bloodshed,
when the adverse clans were about a hundred
yards apart he stepped resolutely forward, sheathed
his sword and requested Stewart of Appin to meet
him half-way.  Stewart accordingly sheathed his
weapon, and also stepped forward from his line.
</p>

<p>
"Appin," said Rob, "I am deeply grieved that
those who bear the royal name should come as
invaders into the land of Clan Alpine, whose race
is also royal.  Our forefathers were friends, and
stood side by side in battle on the braes of
Rannoch.  The same inscription is on both our
sword-blades&mdash;see," he added, showing the favourite
legend, usually carved on all Scottish swords
between 1707 and 1746,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
"PROSPERITY TO SCOTLAND, AND NO UNION."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I have come but to right my kinsman Invernentie,
and restore to him the lands of which your
people have reft him," replied Appin.
</p>

<p>
"Those lands were ours of old, Appin.  But
hearken! we are all loyal men to <i>the King</i>, and it
were a pity we should weaken our mutual strength
by mortal conflict, so I shall consent that Hamish
MacLaren hold the lands of Invernentie at an easy
quit-rent."
</p>

<p>
"To that will I agree blythely," said Appin, who
was a tall, brave, and handsome man, dressed in
scarlet Stewart tartan, with a grass-green coat
covered with gold lace, and who had in his bonnet
a white rose, with the three feathers of his rank.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well&mdash;so there's my thumb on't," said
Rob, as they shook hands.  "But now," he added,
"as we have here so many gallant men in arms, it
will be a shameful thing if we all separate 'thout a
trial of skill; so I here take the liberty of inviting
any gentleman Stewart to exchange a few blows
with me for the honour of our respective clans."
</p>

<p>
On this, Appin's brother-in-law, Alaster of
Invernahyle, sprang forward, exclaiming,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I accept the challenge!"
</p>

<p>
"Good; and we shall lower our swords when the
first blood is drawn."
</p>

<p>
The pipers struck up on both sides, as the two
combatants engaged with claymore, dirk, and
target; but in a few minutes the red blood spirted
from the sword-arm of Rob Roy, who immediately
lowered his blade, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I congratulate you, Alaster of Invernahyle, on
being one of the very few who have drawn blood
from the veins of Rob Roy."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Stewart, as he offered his handkerchief
to bind up the wound, "without the advantages
which youth and its agility give me, I had
come off with neither honour nor safety."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, MacGregor," said Appin, "that
your brave blood has alone been shed here to-day.
Farewell!&mdash;we go back to the braes of Appin.  If
I survive you, this hand shall lay the first stone of
your cairn and bid it speak to future times."
</p>

<p>
"To you, Appin, thanks! you must indeed survive
me.  The Red MacGregor is <i>red</i> only in name
now&mdash;his hair is white as the snows on Ben
Lomond."
</p>

<p>
This was his <i>last</i> appearance in arms.
</p>

<p>
Some time after this, in a trial of strength with
Stewart of Ardsheil, finding his eyesight dim, his
sword-arm weak, and that he was compelled to give
ground, his cheek&mdash;a wrinkled cheek now&mdash;flushed
red with shame; tears stood in his eyes, and
he flung his old and faithful blade upon the
heather.
</p>

<p>
"Never have I drawn thee without honour," he
exclaimed; "but alas! never shall I draw thee
more!"
</p>

<p>
Ardsheil, a generous and high-spirited gentleman,
was deeply moved by the grief of the old warrior
for his own decay of strength.  Picking up the
claymore, and presenting the hilt to Rob Roy, he
politely raised his bonnet, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Shame on me, shame that I should have drawn
on years and bravery such as yours!  But give me
your hand, MacGregor&mdash;your hand, and henceforth
let us be friends."
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" said Rob, sadly; "I am too old now
to be your enemy!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LVII.
<br><br>
THE CLOSING SCENE.
</h3>

<p>
The health and strength of Rob Roy decayed
rapidly after this, and the winter of 1734, with its
unusual severity, sorely affected his shattered form.
Helpless as a child, he was confined to bed at last
by extreme old age rather than illness, at his house
of Inverlochluvig.
</p>

<p>
On an evening towards the end of December he
sunk rapidly.  Helen, then an aged woman, was
his constant attendant, and he requested her to
throw open the windows that he might take a last
farewell of the sun, then setting in his ruddy
splendour, and casting the purple shadows of Ben
More far across the snowclad braes of Balquhidder.
</p>

<p>
In the clear, frosty atmosphere of the winter eve
he could hear the cattle lowing in the fold, and the
laughter of the children ringing merrily from the
adjacent clachan, and both were music to the old
man's ear.
</p>

<p>
"Death is at hand, Helen&mdash;close&mdash;close!" said
he, sadly, to his wife; "I may at times have been
harsh&mdash;sharp with you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, never&mdash;never to me, Rob," said she,
sobbing heavily.
</p>

<p>
"If ever so, forgive me!"
</p>

<p>
"Forgive you, my poor old Rob!" she exclaimed,
and threw her arms around him.
</p>

<p>
"I have never asked forgiveness save from those
I loved, and most of them have gone before us,
Helen.  The hands of my forefathers beckon me;
I can see their dim forms amid the blue mist on the
hill!  Has the sun set, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;why?"
</p>

<p>
"It is growing so dark&mdash;so very dark&mdash;open the
window!"
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i> open," said Helen, in a broken voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh that I could but have again the sweet perfume
of the yellow broom and purple heather-bell;
or hear the hum of the mountain-bee and the voice
of the cushat-dove!  But who comes?" he added,
as a step approached softly.
</p>

<p>
'Twas old Alpine, who entered to say that
MacLaren of Invernentie had called to inquire for
him.
</p>

<p>
Then there came over Rob Roy something of the
same impulse which, according to the English
legend, animated the brave freebooter Robin Hood,
when he was propped up on his death-bed, to shoot
a last clothyard shaft with his trusty yew.
</p>

<p>
"MacLaren!" he exclaimed, rallying all his
failing powers, while his sunken eyes flashed with
light; "raise me up, Helen!  Coll!  Hamish!  Robin
Oig! bring me my bonnet and plaid, my pistols,
dirk, and claymore, and <i>then</i> admit him; for never
shall it be said that a foeman saw Rob Roy
defenceless and unarmed!"
</p>

<p>
His commands were immediately obeyed.  MacLaren
entered and paid his compliments by inquiring
after the health of his formidable neighbour, who
maintained a cold and haughty civility during their
brief conference.
</p>

<p>
After MacLaren's departure Rob still sat up in
bed, with his plaid about him, and his sword in his
hand, and he muttered scraps of Ossian with his
prayers.
</p>

<p>
"The winds shall whistle in my grey hair and
not awake me.  The sons of future years shall pass
away&mdash;another race shall rise, for the people are
like the waves of ocean: like the leaves of woody
Morven, they pass away in the rustling blast, and
<i>other</i> leaves lift their green heads on high.*  Now,
Helen&mdash;wife," he added, "all is over!  Strike
up, Alpine, <i>Ha til mi tulidh!</i> (We return no
more!)"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Berrathon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Old and blind almost, like his dying leader,
Alpine, while the hot tears streamed over his
withered cheeks, played that solemn dirge, and ere
it was over Rob Roy had passed away, and Helen
MacGregor and her five sons were on their knees
around a breathless corpse.
</p>

<p>
He expired on the 28th of December, 1734,
in about the eightieth year of his age, and
his demise is recorded thus simply in the
<i>Caledonian Mercury</i> newspaper of 9th January
following:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>On Sunday se'nnight died at Balquhidder, in
Perthshire, the famous Highland partizan, ROB ROY.</i>"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
His funeral was the last in Perthshire at which a
piper was employed, according to General Stewart.
</p>

<p>
Helen did not survive him long.
</p>

<p>
The future of their sons&mdash;that future which had
filled the soul of poor Rob Roy with so many fears
and anxieties&mdash;was varied, and the fate of two was
dark and tragic.
</p>

<p>
History tells us that Hamish commanded the
MacGregors in the army of Prince Charles, and
that he had his leg broken by a cannon-ball at the
battle of Gladsmuir.  He escaped from the Castle
of Edinburgh with characteristic daring, and fled
to France, where a free pardon was offered
him if he would betray another fugitive,
named Allan Breac Stewart; but he declined,
saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I was born a Highland gentleman, and
can never accept that which would make me
the disgrace of my family and the scoff of my
country."
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards he died of <i>starvation</i> in
the streets of Paris, when George III. was king.
</p>

<p>
In his thirteenth year Robin Oig shot MacLaren
of Invernentie dead between the stilts of his plough,
for insulting his mother; and the gun with which
he perpetrated this terrible act is now at Abbotsford.
He fled, became a soldier in the 42nd Regiment,
and fought gallantly at Fontenoy, where he
was wounded and taken prisoner by the French; but
five years after the battle, by an overstrained
power of the officers of the Crown, he died on
the scaffold at Edinburgh.  For the others, I
must refer my readers to Burke's "Landed
Gentry."
</p>

<p>
"Happily, now-a-days," says a recent writer,
"the Celt and the Sassenach&mdash;Scotsman and
Englishman&mdash;fight side by side, under one standard.
<i>How</i> the brave soldiers of the Highlands fight
has been shown in many a glorious struggle&mdash;at
Talavera, Salamanca, and Waterloo; nor will
history forget <i>the thin red line</i> of Balaclava, or
the shrill pibroch of Havelock's small but
gallant force, which came like home-music to the
ears and hearts of those who defended Lucknow!"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
At the east end of the old church of Balquhidder,
within an enclosure formed by the foundations of
the more ancient Catholic place of worship, lies the
grave of Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
It is covered by a rough stone of hard mica, on
which a number of emblems are rudely sculptured.
Among these the figure of a Highlander and a large
broadsword can be distinctly traced.
</p>

<p>
Under this stone, in February, 1754, were also
interred the remains of his son, Robin Oig.
</p>

<p>
Such is the story of ROB ROY the Outlaw.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
